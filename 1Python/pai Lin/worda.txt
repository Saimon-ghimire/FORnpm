When
I
look
in
your
eyes,
and
you’re
looking
back
in
mine,
everything
feels
not
quite
normal.
Because
I
feel
stronger
and
weaker
at
the
same
time,
I
feel
excited
and
at
the
same
time
terrified.
The
truth
is
I
don’t
know
what
I
feel,
except
I
know
what
kind
of
man
I
want
to
be.
It's
as
if
I've
reached
the
unrechable
and
I
wasn't
ready
for
it.

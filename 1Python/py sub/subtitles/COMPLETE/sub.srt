15
00:02:50,693 --> 00:02:52,724
I don't want to have to wait
for full clean-up just to get

16
00:02:52,726 --> 00:02:54,193
- a status report.
- We're collecting this data

17
00:02:54,428 --> 00:02:56,193
- as quickly as possible.
- That's not good enough.

18
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:57,992
Okay, maybe you can tell me
what happened.

19
00:02:57,994 --> 00:02:59,791
There was some kind of breach.
One of the astronauts

20
00:02:59,793 --> 00:03:02,158
- sent a distress call.
- What about the crew?

21
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,791
- We're still investigating.
- Where did it go down?

22
00:03:05,793 --> 00:03:07,792
It's 20 kilometers
west of Sibu.

23
00:03:07,794 --> 00:03:09,992
Did we at least retrieve
all of the samples?

24
00:03:09,994 --> 00:03:11,792
No. We have
three of them.

25
00:03:11,794 --> 00:03:13,758
One of the organisms
got out of containment,

26
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,827
and it's missing.
We don't know which one.

27
00:03:30,661 --> 00:03:31,859
What is she saying?

28
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:33,995
One of the astronauts
is still alive.

29
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:40,993
That's Jameson.

30
00:05:04,697 --> 00:05:06,196
- Morning, sunshine.
- What?

31
00:05:06,198 --> 00:05:07,631
I'm awake.

32
00:05:08,731 --> 00:05:10,063
Missed me.

33
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:11,762
- I'm awake.
- Here you go.

34
00:05:11,764 --> 00:05:13,995
- You can have it back.
- Thank...

35
00:05:13,997 --> 00:05:17,029
Oh, wow,
you're wearing a suit. Yes!

36
00:05:17,031 --> 00:05:19,529
- I love it when you wear the suit.
- Thank you.

37
00:05:19,531 --> 00:05:21,829
I have depositions today
in the Life Foundation case.

38
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:24,096
Hey, let me know
how your meeting goes.

39
00:05:24,098 --> 00:05:25,730
My meeting?

40
00:05:25,732 --> 00:05:27,595
Oh, shit. Yeah.

41
00:05:27,597 --> 00:05:29,498
My meeting.

42
00:05:33,497 --> 00:05:35,997
- Coffee.
- Oh. Mmm!

43
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:37,897
- You are perfect.
- Thank you.

44
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:39,797
Hey, you know what...
You know what night

45
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:41,629
- it is tonight, right?
- Date night.

46
00:05:41,631 --> 00:05:44,563
Mmm-hmm. So, I will pick
you up around, uh, 6:00.

47
00:05:44,565 --> 00:05:46,997
And please do not forget
your helmet.

48
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:48,563
Oh, I'm glad
that you like it,

49
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:50,064
'cause I plan on wearing it
at our wedding.

50
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:51,797
That's hot.

51
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:53,697
Feed the cat.

52
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:54,997
I will.

53
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:56,530
I love you!

54
00:05:56,532 --> 00:05:58,131
Love you, too.
Feed the cat.

Hey, Richard!

73
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:03,234
- Lookin' good!
- Eddie, you can't park there, bro.

74
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:05,565
Come on, man. There's
no such thing as can't.

75
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:06,832
How'd she do?

76
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:09,766
Berkeley. Brown. MIT.

77
00:07:09,768 --> 00:07:11,765
- She's got a scholarship, bro.
- What'd I tell you?

78
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:13,235
You told me what?

79
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:15,201
- No such thing as can't.
- Eddie.

80

The bike.

81

MIT! Whoo!

82
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:24,634
You know what I love
about this view?

83
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:27,235
- It never gets old.
- Yeah, well, uh...

84
00:07:27,468 --> 00:07:30,133
Height's not really my thing.

85
00:07:30,135 --> 00:07:32,701
But, uh...
What's the deal?

86
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:35,068
- I got you the big one, exclusive.
- Yeah? Who?

87
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,700
Carlton Drake.

88
00:07:36,702 --> 00:07:38,734
- Carlton Drake?
- The man's a visionary.

89
00:07:38,736 --> 00:07:40,934
He wants to talk
about his rockets,

90
00:07:40,936 --> 00:07:43,634
assure everyone they're safe,
that the crash was an anomaly.

91
00:07:43,636 --> 00:07:45,001
Uh...

92
00:07:45,003 --> 00:07:47,001
He's... He's seriously off.

93
00:07:47,003 --> 00:07:48,700
I'm gonna level with you.

94
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:51,101
Carlton Drake could buy us
with his pocket cash,

95
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:54,534
turn this building into his
own garage if he so wished.

96
00:07:54,536 --> 00:07:57,534
Now, you're just gonna ask him
about his space program,

97
00:07:57,536 --> 00:07:59,936
you're gonna thank him, and
you're gonna bid him a nice day.

98
00:08:01,537 --> 00:08:04,867
He's a crook.

99
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:08,068
Eddie, when you had nowhere
to go, we gave you a home.

100
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,237
Now, you know we love
the Eddie Brock show.

101
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:13,169
There isn't a better investigative
reporter working today,

102
00:08:13,171 --> 00:08:14,935
but no one
is above the network.

103
00:08:14,937 --> 00:08:18,002
So do me a favor, Eddie,
don't start your shit again.

104
00:08:18,004 --> 00:08:19,702
All right, all right.

105
00:08:19,704 --> 00:08:24,069
- For me.
- All right. I'll do it.

106
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:25,735
I don't know why he gave
me this assignment, Annie.

107
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:27,535
It's not...
It's not what I do.

108
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:29,069
Well, my mother
always told me

109
00:08:29,071 --> 00:08:32,035
that anything in life worth
having would take sacrifice...

110
00:08:32,037 --> 00:08:33,237
- Mmm-hmm.
- Patience...

111
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,668
- Mmm.
- And be a lot of work.

112
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,102
- Oh.
- That's you...

113
00:08:37,104 --> 00:08:38,769
- That's not.
- ...that I'm talking about.

114
00:08:38,771 --> 00:08:39,970
- Nah.
- Yeah.

115
00:08:39,972 --> 00:08:41,170
Well, you're lucky
to have me.

116
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:43,170
To be fair,
I'm quite a catch.

117
00:08:43,172 --> 00:08:45,636
That's what my mom told me.

118
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:47,668
Are you gonna
behave yourself tomorrow?

119
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,903
No. No, I'm gonna do my job.
That's what I'm gonna do.

120
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,970
I can't, you know,
not do my job.

121
00:08:52,972 --> 00:08:54,836
The guy you work for
is a complete...

122
00:08:54,838 --> 00:08:56,903
I don't work for Drake.
I work for my firm,

123
00:08:56,905 --> 00:08:58,536
and my firm works for him.

124
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,003
And I'm sure
that they defend many people

125
00:08:50,705 --> 00:08:53,804
that you don't deem worthy,
but we don't want a repeat.

126
00:09:04,106 --> 00:09:06,869
- A repeat?
- Of the <i>Daily Globe</i> incident.

127
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:08,603
Ow! Really?

128
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:10,205
- Incident? That's not an incident.
- Mmm-hmm.

129
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:11,703
- Baby, you were run out of New York.
- I was not. I did not.

130
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:13,104
I don't want you
run out of San Francisco.

131
00:09:13,106 --> 00:09:15,637
No, I still have
currency in New York.

132
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,937
I was going places.

133
00:09:17,939 --> 00:09:19,037
I wasn't running.

134
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,804
I was going places.

135
00:09:20,806 --> 00:09:22,637
In fact, I moved
to San Francisco for you.

136
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,503
- Me?
- You are my home.

137
00:09:25,505 --> 00:09:28,239
You're not so bad yourself,
champ.

138
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,905
- Less talking, more kissing.
- All right.

139
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,172
Let's just get the check.

140
00:10:02,774 --> 00:10:04,873
I'm gonna get a drink.

141
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:50,508
Shh.

142
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:09,074
Very soon,
another Life Foundation rocket

143
00:11:09,076 --> 00:11:11,640
will be sent
on an exploratory mission.

144
00:11:11,642 --> 00:11:14,907
And that's how, one day,
we might all live in space.

145
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:17,606
Cool, huh? And now that I've shown you

146
00:11:17,608 --> 00:11:19,740
some of the cool stuff
that we do here,

147
00:11:19,742 --> 00:11:22,008
I'm hoping I've inspired
each and every one of you

148
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,208
to go out there
and create things that others

149
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,607
- have only dreamt of.
- Mr. Drake?

150
00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:29,674
- Shh!
- It's okay. Don't silence her.

151
00:11:29,676 --> 00:11:31,607
Come here. What's your name?

152
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:33,641
- Allie.
- It's okay, Allie.

153
00:11:33,643 --> 00:11:35,211
You know, sometimes
that's what people do.

154
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,908
They try and silence
those of us who ask questions.

155
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,976
But you know what?
In the end,

156
00:11:39,978 --> 00:11:42,908
we're the ones
who change the world.

157
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,842
Take good care
of that, Allie.

158
00:11:45,844 --> 00:11:47,607
Guys, this is Dr. Skirth.

159
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:48,975
- Say hi.
- Hi.

160
00:11:48,977 --> 00:11:50,176
Hello, kids.

161
00:11:50,178 --> 00:11:52,208
Um, sorry to interrupt,

162
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,574
but it's time to get changed
for your interview.

163
00:11:54,576 --> 00:11:56,775
Yeah. Uh, kids,
sorry to leave you.

164
00:11:56,777 --> 00:11:59,076
Allie, you're in charge.
High five up top.

165
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:02,542
Dr. Skirth will answer Allie's
question, and any others.

166
00:12:02,544 --> 00:12:04,211
- See you next time, guys. Bye!
- Bye!

167
00:12:04,445 --> 00:12:06,244
<i>What do you say,
Mr. Drake,</i>

168
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:08,209
we just start
at the beginning?

169
00:12:08,211 --> 00:12:10,244
- Born to British parents.
- Mmm-hmm.

170
00:12:10,477 --> 00:12:13,775
And then at 19, you
discovered a gene therapy

171
00:12:13,777 --> 00:12:16,575
that literally doubles
the life expectancy

172
00:12:16,577 --> 00:12:18,077
- of pancreatic cancer patients.
- Well, actually,

173
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,142
it tripled their
life expectancy.

174
00:12:20,144 --> 00:12:21,810
But it's okay.

175
00:12:21,812 --> 00:12:24,843
Okay, um, 24.
That's still extremely young.

176
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,842
All right, you create

177
00:12:26,844 --> 00:12:28,543
- the Life Foundation!
- It didn't happen overnight.

178
00:12:28,545 --> 00:12:30,210
- And then...
- Rockets.

179
00:12:30,212 --> 00:12:32,212
You then decide,
like any normal human being,

180
00:12:32,446 --> 00:12:34,212
that you're gonna go
and explore space.

181
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:36,743
You know what it is?
I have always believed...

182
00:12:36,745 --> 00:12:38,576
- Uh-huh.
- ...that space exploration

183
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:40,177
is crucial
in our quest to cure

184
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:42,111
everything that ails us
here on Earth.

185
00:12:42,113 --> 00:12:43,676
But if you think about
everything we've found...

186
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:45,110
- Uh-huh.
- ...in the oceans and on land,

187
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:47,044
- isn't it time to look up there?
- Mmm-hmm.

188
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:49,544
To this plethora
of untapped resources?

189
00:12:49,546 --> 00:12:51,043
And you have a plethora
of untapped resources, also,

190
00:12:51,045 --> 00:12:52,877
from your pharmaceutical
companies

191
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,676
that you're involved with,
you know, to help you realize

192
00:12:54,678 --> 00:12:55,876
- that ambition, I suppose.
- Of course.

193
00:12:55,878 --> 00:12:57,211
- Yeah.
- Full circle.

194
00:12:57,213 --> 00:12:59,510
So, I have to ask,
how does that work,

195
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,111
you know, exactly,
the Life Foundation thing?

196
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,111
How does it...
How does it, um...

197
00:13:03,113 --> 00:13:05,044
I don't know,
how does it go about,

198
00:13:05,046 --> 00:13:08,111
- say, testing pharmaceuticals?
- Eddie, we're talking

199
00:13:08,113 --> 00:13:09,945
- about the rocket here.
- No, I'm not. I'm not.

200
00:13:09,947 --> 00:13:11,944
I'm talking
about the allegations.

201
00:13:11,946 --> 00:13:13,545
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- It says that

202
00:13:13,547 --> 00:13:15,044
your entire empire
has been built

203
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:17,112
- on dead bodies.
- Eddie.

204
00:13:17,114 --> 00:13:19,545
It's true, right?
It says that you recruit

205
00:13:19,547 --> 00:13:21,745
the most vulnerable of us
to volunteer for tests...

206
00:13:21,747 --> 00:13:23,079
- Hmm.
- ...that more often than not

207
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:24,644
end up killing people.

208
00:13:24,646 --> 00:13:26,145
Yeah, I'm aware
of these rumors online.

209
00:13:26,147 --> 00:13:27,511
There's a lot of fake news
out there these days.

210
00:13:27,513 --> 00:13:28,945
Right. What about
the legal cases?

211
00:13:28,947 --> 00:13:30,510
Sorry?

212
00:13:30,512 --> 00:13:32,645
Uh, the actual legal cases,
like Sarah Chambers,

213
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:34,578
- Phil Barclay, Rob MacDonald.
- That's it. Time to go.

214
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,912
Thank you so much for coming
to talk to me, Mr. Brock.

215
00:13:35,914 --> 00:13:37,511
And they're just some
of the people who walked

216
00:13:37,513 --> 00:13:39,511
- through these doors...
- Have a nice day.

217
00:13:39,513 --> 00:13:41,179
- Cut the camera off, please.
- Thank you very much.

218
00:13:41,181 --> 00:13:42,878
- Time is up. Come on.
- They're dead. The Dead...

219
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,145
- Could you show him out, please?
- The Dead Found...

220
00:13:44,147 --> 00:13:45,946
Don't touch me.
The Dead Foundation thing.

221
00:13:45,948 --> 00:13:46,813
- Get out of here, Brock.
- We're not finished.

222
00:13:46,815 --> 00:13:47,678
Yes, you are, Mr. Brock.

223
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,545
Is that a threat?

224
00:13:48,547 --> 00:13:50,181
Have a nice life.

225
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,845
I know what
you're going to say, but...

226
00:13:55,847 --> 00:13:58,512
This guy, he is
all the way bad, Jack.

227
00:13:58,514 --> 00:14:00,545
- If you just give...
- Who's your source?

228
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:03,082
- Excuse me?
- Who's your source, Eddie?

229
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:10,512
I don't have a source, per se.
But I have a hunch.

230
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:12,249
This isn't the Wild Wild West.

231
00:14:12,481 --> 00:14:15,213
We don't go off half-cocked
based on a hunch.

232
00:14:15,215 --> 00:14:16,779
We do the work.

233
00:14:16,781 --> 00:14:19,249
We substantiate
our accusations.

234
00:14:19,482 --> 00:14:21,547
We provide evidence.

235
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:24,880
You know, for a smart guy,
you really are a dumbass.

236
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:32,813
You're fired, Eddie.

237
00:14:32,815 --> 00:14:34,814
I can't trust you.

238
00:14:34,816 --> 00:14:37,216
Have a nice life.

239
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,216
- Will just take a second.
- Okay.

240
00:14:40,782 --> 00:14:42,081
Hey.

241
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,081
You are pathologically
self-absorbed.

242
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,613
Annie. Annie,
can you talk to me first?

243
00:14:45,615 --> 00:14:46,647
Your ego requires
constant attention,

244
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:48,714
and you're stubborn as hell.

245
00:14:48,716 --> 00:14:50,947
But I was willing to roll with
it, Eddie, because I loved you.

246
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:53,116
You "loved" me?
What is that supposed to mean?

247
00:14:55,084 --> 00:14:57,149
What you did
got me fired.

248
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,984
You used me.

249
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:10,017
Annie? Annie.

250
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,618
Oh, my God.

251
00:15:47,951 --> 00:15:49,751
You're beautiful.

252
00:17:46,989 --> 00:17:48,686
Test 36.

253
00:17:48,688 --> 00:17:50,220
Biological interactions

254
00:17:50,222 --> 00:17:52,553
between two different organisms.

255
00:17:52,555 --> 00:17:55,154
These creatures need to bond
with a respiratory host

256
00:17:55,156 --> 00:17:57,187
in order to survive
for any amount of time

257
00:17:57,189 --> 00:17:59,020
in an oxygen-rich environment.

258
00:17:59,022 --> 00:18:00,222
Well, why are
all these hosts

259
00:18:00,456 --> 00:18:01,988
showing this hyper-acute
rejection?

260
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,955
That's what
we're trying to find out.

261
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:08,190
The bonding process
is starting.

262
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:14,689
It's equalizing.

263
00:18:20,856 --> 00:18:23,754
But why? Why this rabbit?

264
00:18:23,756 --> 00:18:26,224
- It's similar to an organ transplant.
- Huh.

265
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,188
Where the donor and recipient
must be an exact match?

266
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,754
- That's correct.
- Okay. So wait, think about it.

267
00:18:31,756 --> 00:18:35,621
If we do achieve symbiosis, they
should be able to survive here,

268
00:18:35,623 --> 00:18:39,921
but also we would
be able to survive there.

269
00:18:39,923 --> 00:18:41,621
"We"?

270
00:18:41,623 --> 00:18:43,755
- Begin human trials.
- Oh, it's way too soon

271
00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:45,721
to even begin to think
about something like...

272
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:47,155
Dr. Skirth, you're at the forefront
of a scientific breakthrough.

273
00:18:47,157 --> 00:18:49,655
I need you to hold your nerve.
All right?

274
00:18:49,657 --> 00:18:51,224
I understand,
but it's an ethical question.

275
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,189
Think of future generations.
Think of your kids.

276
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:55,057
Hey, how are your kids?

277
00:18:57,091 --> 00:18:58,589
Let's begin human trials.

278
00:18:58,591 --> 00:18:59,725
Good work.

279
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:23,158
Hey, Jack.

280
00:19:24,858 --> 00:19:27,123
Do you ever feel
like your life

281
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,756
- is like one monumental screwup?
- Nope.

282
00:19:30,758 --> 00:19:32,259
<i>Here at the Life Foundation,</i>

283
00:19:32,491 --> 00:19:34,523
- <i>we've always believed...</i>
- Isn't that your buddy?

284
00:19:34,525 --> 00:19:35,991
<i>...in finding the lessons
in our disappointments.</i>

285
00:19:35,993 --> 00:19:37,689
<i>In the months
since our rocket failed,</i>

286
00:19:37,691 --> 00:19:39,224
<i>we've learned so much.</i>

287
00:19:39,226 --> 00:19:42,225
Do you think we could,
like, switch him off?

288
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,924
Some people
are trying to watch that.

289
00:19:43,926 --> 00:19:45,226
Oh, you are, are you?

290
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,826
- Yeah?
- Aren't you Eddie Brock?

291
00:19:49,726 --> 00:19:51,226
I used to be.

292
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,124
<i>We take
the same view of progress.</i>

293
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:55,757
<i>Thrilled to announce
that the Life Foundation</i>

294
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,725
<i>has now begun preparations
on its next launch.</i>

295
00:19:58,727 --> 00:20:00,124
All right, Jack,
this is for you.

296
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:02,092
I do not want you
to spend it all at once.

297
00:20:02,094 --> 00:20:04,124
I'm going to go home and chase
myself around the room,

298
00:20:04,126 --> 00:20:06,124
playing hard to get.

299
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:11,591
- Hey, Maria.
- Eddie.

300
00:20:11,593 --> 00:20:14,225
- How's it going?
- Righteous, Eddie.

301
00:20:14,227 --> 00:20:16,227
Oh! Yeah, we're empty.

302
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,591
Cost you $5.

303
00:20:20,593 --> 00:20:22,725
$5 for a paper that's free?

304
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:24,725
I walked all the way over
to the vending machine,

305
00:20:24,727 --> 00:20:27,525
got the papers out and
brought 'em back over here,

306
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,993
so you can have 'em
personally delivered to you.

307
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,059
You did that for me?

308
00:20:31,061 --> 00:20:32,660
- Yes, I did.
- Oh.

309
00:20:34,194 --> 00:20:36,726
- Five bucks.
- That's pretty steep.

310
00:20:36,728 --> 00:20:39,159
Tell you what, you give
me a dollar for a song,

311
00:20:39,161 --> 00:20:40,825
I'll throw in the paper.

312
00:20:40,827 --> 00:20:43,558
I'll tell you what,
I will give you 20 bucks,

313
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,028
but not to sing,
all right?

314
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,792
Deal.

315
00:20:46,794 --> 00:20:48,692
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

316
00:20:48,694 --> 00:20:52,525
No. You're welcome.

317
00:20:52,527 --> 00:20:54,826
Hey, Mrs. Chen.

318
00:20:54,828 --> 00:20:57,093
- How you doing, Eddie?
- Ah, aches and pains,

319
00:20:57,095 --> 00:20:59,093
you know, aches and pains.

320
00:20:59,095 --> 00:21:00,261
You look like shit.

321
00:21:01,162 --> 00:21:02,659
Excuse me?

322
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,028
You look like shit.

323
00:21:05,595 --> 00:21:08,227
And you look
as beautiful as ever.

324
00:21:08,229 --> 00:21:10,959
- Jesus.
- Mind is body, Eddie.

325
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:12,827
Have you been meditating
like I showed you?

326
00:21:12,829 --> 00:21:14,827
- No, I have not. And it does not work.
- It doesn't work,

327
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:16,959
- because you don't give it a chance.
- No, it doesn't work,

328
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:20,160
because I bought a DVD off your
cousin, and it was in Mandarin.

329
00:21:20,162 --> 00:21:22,960
Yeah, I don't understand that, either.

330
00:21:22,962 --> 00:21:24,693
See, that right there, I don't
understand what you just said.

331
00:21:24,695 --> 00:21:25,860
That is the problem.

332
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:33,727
Bottle of whiskey,
and don't forget my change.

333
00:21:33,729 --> 00:21:36,127
Please.

334
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,593
Let's go.

335
00:21:37,595 --> 00:21:39,095
Before the price goes up
for my protection.

336
00:21:41,896 --> 00:21:45,128
The full payment is due.
Now.

337
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,228
Make sure you have
my money ready, Chen.

338
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,930
I don't like to wait.

339
00:22:07,098 --> 00:22:08,198
Life hurts, Eddie.

340
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,197
It just does.

341
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,528
I gotta go.

342
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:34,596
- Okay. Love you, babe.
- See you, babe.

343
00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:39,230
What a dick.

344
00:23:08,732 --> 00:23:10,564
I'm not even
asking to staff there.

345
00:23:10,566 --> 00:23:12,097
Why would I do that?
I can't use my name.

346
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,563
I can use a pseudonym.

347
00:23:13,565 --> 00:23:15,031
Any name. Think...
You pick a name.

348
00:23:15,033 --> 00:23:17,030
I could be a woman.
Have you seen <i>Tootsie?</i>

349
00:23:22,865 --> 00:23:23,930
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

350
00:23:23,932 --> 00:23:25,799
Okay, I won't. Thank you. Bye.

351
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:37,231
<i>Realize deeply that the
present moment is all you ever have.</i>

352
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:41,064
<i>Make the now the primary
focus of your life.</i>

353
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:43,530
<i>Any action is often better
than no action,</i>

354
00:23:43,532 --> 00:23:45,165
<i>especially if you
have been stuck</i>

355
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:48,898
<i>in an unhappy situation
for a long time.</i>

356
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,898
<i>If it is a mistake, at least
you learned something,</i>

357
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,531
<i>in which case
it's no longer...</i>

358
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,765
Thank you all for
bringing us to this moment.

359
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:20,200
Our names will be spoken
long after we are dust.

360
00:24:20,202 --> 00:24:21,867
History starts now.

361
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,566
This is day one.

362
00:24:24,568 --> 00:24:27,833
This is first contact.

363
00:24:27,835 --> 00:24:30,200
Let's get to work.

364
00:24:43,035 --> 00:24:45,169
<i>Establishing subject baseline.</i>

365
00:24:47,202 --> 00:24:49,501
<i>All vital signs are normal.</i>

366
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:58,234
Put me through.

367
00:24:58,236 --> 00:25:00,069
There's no need to be
frightened, Isaac.

368
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:03,867
There's no need.

369
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,900
Isaac. You know
that's a biblical name?

370
00:25:06,902 --> 00:25:08,934
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

371
00:25:08,936 --> 00:25:11,067
<i>God said to Abraham,
"Give me your son,</i>

372
00:25:11,069 --> 00:25:13,800
<i>"show me you are willing
to sacrifice the one thing</i>

373
00:25:13,802 --> 00:25:16,967
"most precious to you,"
and Abraham was willing.

374
00:25:16,969 --> 00:25:19,034
You know what's always
impressed me about that story?

375
00:25:19,036 --> 00:25:22,104
<i>It isn't Abraham's sacrifice.
It's Isaac's.</i>

376
00:25:26,737 --> 00:25:29,634
<i>Now, I don't know what kind of
God would ask that of someone,</i>

377
00:25:29,636 --> 00:25:30,968
<i>but it doesn't change
anything for me.</i>

378
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:35,768
Isaac is still the hero
of this story.

379
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:38,668
Look around you.
Look at the world.

380
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,135
<i>What do you see?
War, poverty,</i>

381
00:25:40,137 --> 00:25:42,270
<i>a planet on the brink
of collapse.</i>

382
00:25:42,503 --> 00:25:45,568
<i>I would argue that God
has abandoned us.</i>

383
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,202
He didn't keep
his end of the bargain, Isaac,

384
00:25:47,204 --> 00:25:50,235
<i>so now it's down to you and me
to put this right.</i>

385
00:25:50,237 --> 00:25:52,770
<i>And this time, Isaac,
we can.</i>

386
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,768
We will.

387
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:01,838
<i>This time,
I will not abandon us.</i>

388
00:26:04,171 --> 00:26:05,238
<i>Yes.</i>

389
00:26:08,139 --> 00:26:09,138
Open it.

390
00:26:22,106 --> 00:26:24,203
What the hell is that?
What? No, what...

391
00:26:24,205 --> 00:26:25,937
<i>Please let me... No.</i>

392
00:26:25,939 --> 00:26:28,104
Oh, please, please, please!

393
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:48,237
His vitals are holding steady.

394
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:50,938
- Where the hell did it go?
- <i>Incredible.</i>

395
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,506
<i>Where did it go?</i>

396
00:26:57,107 --> 00:26:58,670
<i>Where is it?</i>

397
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,941
Bring in the next volunteer.

398
00:28:06,974 --> 00:28:09,673
You know,
I used to be a reporter.

399
00:28:09,675 --> 00:28:11,073
I was...

400
00:28:11,075 --> 00:28:13,806
I was pretty successful,
as well, you know?

401
00:28:13,808 --> 00:28:17,973
My job, it required you to...
You know, to follow people

402
00:28:17,975 --> 00:28:23,276
that did not want to be followed
and hide in plain sight.

403
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:25,073
I mean...

404
00:28:25,075 --> 00:28:26,876
You have to know
how to disappear.

405
00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:31,941
I was pretty good, but,
you know, you...

406
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,876
Whoever you are, you suck.

407
00:28:34,876 --> 00:28:36,840
Okay.

408
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:38,907
- Uh, my name is Dora Skirth.
- Mmm.

409
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:40,241
I need your help.

410
00:28:40,243 --> 00:28:41,941
- I work at the Life Foundation.
- You do?

411
00:28:41,943 --> 00:28:43,674
- Yes.
- Wow. Good for you.

412
00:28:43,676 --> 00:28:45,674
We're done.

413
00:28:45,676 --> 00:28:47,274
No...

414
00:28:47,276 --> 00:28:50,607
Mr. Brock, please...
Please listen to me.

415
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:52,674
Everything that you
accused him of,

416
00:28:52,676 --> 00:28:54,008
you were right.
It's all true.

417
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,540
- I don't care anymore.
- Really?

418
00:28:55,542 --> 00:28:57,607
Because he's got a lab
filled with poor people,

419
00:28:57,609 --> 00:28:59,941
and they're all signing waivers
that they don't understand,

420
00:28:59,943 --> 00:29:01,775
and he's using them
like guinea pigs,

421
00:29:01,777 --> 00:29:03,842
and they are dying.

422
00:29:03,844 --> 00:29:05,941
They are all dying.

423
00:29:05,943 --> 00:29:07,510
- You've seen that?
- Yes.

424
00:29:08,478 --> 00:29:09,677
Come here.

425
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:12,908
Why would I believe you?

426
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,075
Because it's true.

427
00:29:14,077 --> 00:29:15,842
I believed in him, and I...

428
00:29:15,844 --> 00:29:17,775
I told myself
that it was worth it

429
00:29:17,777 --> 00:29:19,943
because we were curing cancer,
but now this is different.

430
00:29:19,945 --> 00:29:21,277
- Something else.
- Go to the cops.

431
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,808
I can't do that.

432
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,609
I'm afraid of what
will happen to my family.

433
00:29:24,611 --> 00:29:26,242
He's a very dangerous man, and
he's a very powerful man...

434
00:29:26,244 --> 00:29:27,909
I know, I know
how dangerous he is,

435
00:29:27,911 --> 00:29:29,576
because the very first time
I interviewed him,

436
00:29:29,578 --> 00:29:31,776
just once, I lose my job
the very next day.

437
00:29:31,778 --> 00:29:34,143
I lost my career,
I lost my relationship,

438
00:29:34,145 --> 00:29:36,908
I lost my apartment, I lost
everything I ever cared about.

439
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:39,211
You know why? Carlton Drake
ruined me. Finished.

440
00:29:40,644 --> 00:29:42,743
Now, if you are
who you say you are,

441
00:29:42,745 --> 00:29:45,043
genuinely,
and you have proof,

442
00:29:45,045 --> 00:29:48,110
then you should be
very, very, very afraid.

443
00:29:48,112 --> 00:29:50,143
I am.

444
00:29:50,145 --> 00:29:52,143
You need to find yourself another
white knight, Ms. Skirth,

445
00:29:52,145 --> 00:29:53,609
because I am done.

446
00:29:53,611 --> 00:29:54,978
I am done
with all of this shit.

447
00:29:55,846 --> 00:29:57,210
What shit?

448
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,176
All of this "saving my
fellow man" shit.

449
00:30:00,178 --> 00:30:01,746
All right? Good night.

450
00:30:20,912 --> 00:30:21,912
Eddie?

451
00:30:22,979 --> 00:30:24,279
Well, hey. Whoa.

452
00:30:24,513 --> 00:30:27,543
Anne, I was just walking by,
and, uh...

453
00:30:27,545 --> 00:30:28,877
I saw Mr. Belvedere.

454
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:30,644
I felt concerned for
his welfare, so...

455
00:30:30,646 --> 00:30:32,246
Eddie...

456
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,078
This is Dan.

457
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,112
- Dan, this is Eddie.
- Yeah.

458
00:30:36,114 --> 00:30:37,845
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

459
00:30:37,847 --> 00:30:39,279
- Yeah.
- Annie's told me a lot about you.

460
00:30:39,513 --> 00:30:40,577
- Really?
- Yeah.

461
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:42,578
I'm a big fan of your work.

462
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,911
- Thank you.
- Really?

463
00:30:44,913 --> 00:30:47,114
It's pretty cool, all the
people that he took down.

464
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:49,546
Yeah, I was one of them.

465
00:30:51,713 --> 00:30:53,078
Well, look,
I'll let you guys catch up.

466
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,713
- So I'll see you inside?
- You're the best.

467
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,580
- Really nice meeting you, man.
- Uh, you, too.

468
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,781
He has a key. You know he has a key?

469
00:31:08,914 --> 00:31:11,146
Yeah. How else
would he get in?

470
00:31:13,048 --> 00:31:16,612
Yeah. Well, uh...

471
00:31:16,614 --> 00:31:19,013
So, uh, what you up to?

472
00:31:19,015 --> 00:31:22,213

from being any of your business, right?

Hey, well, just asking,
you know.

474
00:31:25,482 --> 00:31:27,812
So, is Dan, uh, a lawyer?

475
00:31:27,814 --> 00:31:29,779
No, he's a doctor.

476
00:31:29,781 --> 00:31:31,815
- Surgeon, actually.
- Oh.

477
00:31:33,181 --> 00:31:34,812
How's Mr. Belvedere, anyway?

478
00:31:34,814 --> 00:31:36,247
I would say
that he misses you,

479
00:31:36,249 --> 00:31:38,013
but that would be bullshit,
'cause...

480
00:31:38,015 --> 00:31:39,713
- He's a cat.
- No, because he never liked you.

481
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:41,114
No, he's a cat,
and cats don't like anyone.

482
00:31:41,116 --> 00:31:43,249
You look good, by the way.

483
00:31:43,483 --> 00:31:44,680

doing here, Eddie?

484
00:31:44,682 --> 00:31:45,749
I'm here 'cause I miss you.

485
00:31:46,849 --> 00:31:48,746
A lot.

486
00:31:48,748 --> 00:31:50,147
You know, we were gonna
get married.

487
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:52,713
That wasn't so long ago,
and now, you know...

488
00:31:52,715 --> 00:31:54,616
I can't really believe
that we're not...

489

No, we can't.

503
00:33:38,606 --> 00:33:40,571
Yeah, got it, right.

504
00:33:40,573 --> 00:33:43,604

away from an uninhabitable Earth.

505
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:46,437
- Uh, yeah.
- Drake is using his personal rockets

506
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:48,537
to scout real estate.

507
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:50,404
You know, it's a really
interesting story,

508
00:33:50,406 --> 00:33:52,538
but we need to just get to the
part where he's killing people.

509
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,604
Drake sent a ship
on a recon mission.

510
00:33:55,606 --> 00:33:58,438
On the way back,
they found a comet.

511
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,739
A comet?

512

Onboard computers indicated the presence
of life, of millions of organisms.

513

Wait, wait, wait, when you
say "millions of organisms,"

514
00:34:05,741 --> 00:34:07,538
- what do you mean?
- We brought back some specimens.

515
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,974
You're talking about aliens?

516
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:11,605

Yes.

520
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,440
But we don't
call them that.

521
00:34:20,273 --> 00:34:22,305
- We call them Symbiotes.
- Symbiotes?

522
00:34:22,307 --> 00:34:24,973
And they cannot survive in
our environment without help.

523
00:34:24,975 --> 00:34:29,439
Drake believes that the union
between human and Symbiote

524
00:34:29,441 --> 00:34:32,305
is the key to our survival,
but not here on Earth.

525
00:34:32,307 --> 00:34:36,773
Drake is trying to put human
beings and aliens together?

526
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:38,271
So they can live in space?

527

We call them hosts.

528
00:34:39,707 --> 00:34:42,506
That's nuts, isn't it?
That's completely insane.

00:42:51,423 --> 00:42:52,590
Eddie, Jesus!

627
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,723
This is dead.

628
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:56,689
Dead.

629
00:42:56,691 --> 00:42:58,321
Eddie, sit down.

630
00:42:58,323 --> 00:43:00,288
Okay, all right. Okay.

631
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:01,855
- Hey, hey, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.
- Stop that.

632
00:43:01,857 --> 00:43:03,489
- Sir, sir, sir, I'm so sorry.
- Eddie, quit it.

633
00:43:03,491 --> 00:43:04,622
Put it down. Eddie!

634
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:06,656
Snap out of it!

635
00:43:08,557 --> 00:43:09,689
No.

636
00:43:09,691 --> 00:43:11,455
All right. It's no good.

637
00:43:11,457 --> 00:43:12,889
Bobby,
are you all right?

638
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:14,024
- Hey!
- Whoa!

639
00:43:14,257 --> 00:43:15,922
Hey, hey, hey.

640
00:43:15,924 --> 00:43:16,924
I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor.

641
00:43:18,624 --> 00:43:20,555
I'm hot.
Is anyone else hot?

642
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:21,756
Are you hurt?

643
00:43:21,758 --> 00:43:22,990
- Sir, excuse me.
- No! Shh!

644
00:43:22,992 --> 00:43:24,689
Wait,
where are you going? Eddie?

645
00:43:24,691 --> 00:43:26,288
This is unacceptable.
I'm gonna call the police.

646
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:27,723
What are you doing?
No, please don't.

647
00:43:27,725 --> 00:43:29,289
- No.
- Eddie, please.

648
00:43:29,291 --> 00:43:30,389
Oh, my God.

649
00:43:30,391 --> 00:43:32,656
Ah.

650
00:43:37,226 --> 00:43:38,857
- Now I'm gonna call the police.
- No, no. Please don't call the police.

651
00:43:38,859 --> 00:43:40,258
Here, call an ambulance. I'm a doctor.
This man is my, um...

652
00:43:40,959 --> 00:43:42,623
Patient.

653
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:44,289
Oh, it's much better.

654
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:45,690
You are insane.

655
00:43:45,692 --> 00:43:46,992
- He's killing people.
- Who's killing people?

656
00:43:47,227 --> 00:43:48,623
- Carlton Drake.
- Oh, God, Eddie,

657
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:49,790
- not this again.
- Yes, he is. He is!

658
00:43:49,792 --> 00:43:52,323
And I have proof!

659
00:43:52,325 --> 00:43:53,556
Ugh.

660
00:43:59,825 --> 00:44:02,459
- Hey, Eddie...
- Hmm?

661
00:44:07,593 --> 00:44:08,793
Eddie.

662
00:44:09,993 --> 00:44:11,391
Eddie?

663
00:44:12,526 --> 00:44:13,860
Eddie, can you hear me?

664
00:44:15,326 --> 00:44:16,392
This is Dan speaking to you.

665
00:44:17,693 --> 00:44:20,357
Hey, Dan.

666
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:21,825
- <i>Welcome back.</i>
- Where am I?

667
00:44:21,827 --> 00:44:23,291
<i>Uh, you're in the MRI.</i>

668
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:24,858
<i>Okay, we've given you
a little sedative.</i>

669
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,625
- Where is Anne?
- <i>Anne is not here right now.</i>

670
00:44:27,627 --> 00:44:29,027
<i>We're gonna run
some tests, okay?</i>

671
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,525
<i>It's gonna be completely
painless.</i>

672
00:44:30,527 --> 00:44:32,358
<i>So, you know,
just try to stay still.</i>

673
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,027
<i>Uh, relax, and, um...</i>

674
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,325
<i>Yeah, here we go.</i>

675
00:44:42,527 --> 00:44:43,859
Eddie, what's happening
in there?

676
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:45,458
<i>Eddie, you okay?</i>

677
00:44:49,727 --> 00:44:51,458
Shut it down.

678
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:54,525
Hey, hey, hey.

679
00:44:54,527 --> 00:44:55,725
You're okay. Yeah.

680
00:44:55,727 --> 00:44:57,860
Coming out. You all right?

681
00:44:57,862 --> 00:44:59,458
- Yeah.
- Here, look at me, look at me.

682
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,959
- You okay?
- Yeah.

683
00:45:00,961 --> 00:45:02,893
- All right.
- Just take a deep breath. Okay? You're okay.

684
00:45:02,895 --> 00:45:04,893
Yeah.

685
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,692
<i>Now, listen, you're not the
first person to freak out in there.</i>

686
00:45:06,694 --> 00:45:08,526
I get claustrophobic, too.

687
00:45:08,528 --> 00:45:10,028
Dr. Lewis?

688
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,392
- Oh, boy.
- Hey, Mrs. Manfredi. How are you?

689
00:45:12,394 --> 00:45:13,960
Oh, I just saw Morris.

690
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:17,028
And he's whining and complaining
like an old baby again.

691
00:45:17,295 --> 00:45:18,995
- Oh, good.
- Oh, thank you so much.

692
00:45:19,229 --> 00:45:21,292
Yeah, my pleasure.

693
00:45:21,294 --> 00:45:22,993
Okay, Mrs. Manfredi,
we talked about the dog.

694
00:45:22,995 --> 00:45:24,593
Okay, love the dog.
You can't have the dog.

695
00:45:24,595 --> 00:45:26,660
Sorry. Gemini.

696
00:45:26,662 --> 00:45:28,292
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
All right? That I can promise you.

697
00:45:28,294 --> 00:45:29,726
- But for now, go home, get some rest.
- Uh-huh.

698
00:45:29,728 --> 00:45:31,293
I'll call you when
your tests are in.

699
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:32,627
- All right, thank you.
- Okay? Yep.

700
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:33,763
- Thank you, Dan. Thank you.
- You got it.

701
00:45:36,362 --> 00:45:37,760
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hi.

702
00:45:37,762 --> 00:45:38,993
Did you have
the same reactions

703
00:45:38,995 --> 00:45:40,660
regardless
of the temperature...

704
00:45:43,562 --> 00:45:45,262
Good afternoon,
Dr. Skirth.

705
00:45:50,462 --> 00:45:52,594
The creature
and the host are one.

706
00:45:52,596 --> 00:45:54,029
Everything was fine.

707
00:45:54,263 --> 00:45:56,862
So, why does the human
continue to waste away?

708
00:45:56,864 --> 00:45:59,861
I don't know. We've given him enough
liquid nutrition to feed an elephant.

709
00:45:59,863 --> 00:46:01,394
But the organism
is unaffected?

710
00:46:01,396 --> 00:46:02,762
- The Symbiote is thriving.
- Good.

711
00:46:02,764 --> 00:46:04,962
But once again,
it's killing the host.

712
00:46:04,964 --> 00:46:05,997
It's consuming his organs.

713
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:08,663
Oh, watch this.

714
00:46:12,997 --> 00:46:14,661
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
You're hurting it. Stop it!

715
00:46:16,563 --> 00:46:19,561
Sounds in the 4,000 to 6,000 hertz
range are very harmful for it.

716
00:46:19,563 --> 00:46:21,998
- Well, then don't make those sounds.
- Okay.

717
00:46:23,497 --> 00:46:25,294
He was stabilizing.
What happened?

718
00:46:25,296 --> 00:46:26,430
He's approaching
acute liver failure.

719
00:46:27,597 --> 00:46:29,528
We're gonna need another host.

720
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:31,562
Such poor design.

721
00:46:31,564 --> 00:46:34,394
- Excuse me?
- Human beings.

722
00:46:34,396 --> 00:46:35,663
Sorry to interrupt.

723
00:46:38,431 --> 00:46:40,031
Thought you'd like
some good news.

724
00:46:40,263 --> 00:46:41,965
I'm sorry.

725
00:46:52,698 --> 00:46:54,031
<i>Hungry!</i>

726
00:46:54,265 --> 00:46:56,429
Oh, goddamn.

727
00:46:56,431 --> 00:46:58,329
I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.

728
00:46:58,331 --> 00:47:00,529
Can I get through, please?
Excuse me.

729
00:47:00,531 --> 00:47:01,829
Thank you.

730
00:47:01,831 --> 00:47:03,395
I'm just gonna stay here,
all right?

731
00:47:03,397 --> 00:47:05,966
Until the cable car stops.

732
00:47:10,899 --> 00:47:12,997
We're good.
All right. Thank you.

733
00:47:12,999 --> 00:47:14,998
Excuse me.

734
00:47:20,332 --> 00:47:21,396
Oh, hey, Anne.

735
00:47:21,398 --> 00:47:24,364
Eddie, hi. How you feeling?

736
00:47:24,366 --> 00:47:26,032
Oh, feeling... I'm sick.

737
00:47:26,265 --> 00:47:29,363
Well, Eddie,
you have a parasite.

738
00:47:29,365 --> 00:47:30,999
They're not exactly sure
how you got it,

739
00:47:31,234 --> 00:47:32,964
but it would
explain the fever.

740
00:47:32,966 --> 00:47:34,563
<i>That would make sense.</i>

741
00:47:34,565 --> 00:47:38,431
Also, I'm hearing,
uh, a voice.

742
00:47:38,433 --> 00:47:40,330
<i>Auditory hallucinations
are actually very common.</i>

743
00:47:40,332 --> 00:47:41,698
Oh, hey, Dan.
How you doing?

744
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,331
<i>I didn't realize that
you were on the call, too.</i>

745
00:47:43,333 --> 00:47:45,564
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Mmm.

746
00:47:45,566 --> 00:47:47,464
Hey, Dan,
would this parasite...

747
00:47:47,466 --> 00:47:49,397
Would it, like, be able to
make me, I don't know...

748
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:52,531
Like, climb a really, really,
really tall tree,

749
00:47:52,533 --> 00:47:54,564
but super, super fast?

750
00:47:54,566 --> 00:47:56,331
<i>Yes. We just did.</i>

751
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:57,698
<i>Uh, well, Eddie,
it sounds like</i>

752
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,564
it might be causing
some metabolic abnormalities

753
00:47:59,566 --> 00:48:01,731
that are making it hard for your
body to maintain homeostasis.

754
00:48:01,733 --> 00:48:04,631
You said "causing" and "body,"
and... I lost you.

755
00:48:04,633 --> 00:48:06,598
Listen, Eddie, um, we are
gonna get you on some meds,

756
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:07,931
and we are gonna
clear that out.

757
00:48:07,933 --> 00:48:09,499
- Yes.
- <i>Never gonna happen.</i>

758
00:48:09,501 --> 00:48:12,001
Will you stop doing that now.
Not now.

759
00:48:12,235 --> 00:48:13,898
- Eddie, we're just trying to help you.
- <i>I know.</i>

760
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,432
I know. I'm just, I'm not
actually talking to you, Annie.

761
00:48:16,434 --> 00:48:17,899
Who are you talking to?

762
00:48:17,901 --> 00:48:19,799
I'm just gonna call you back,
all right?

763
00:48:19,801 --> 00:48:22,699
Thank you. Thank you, Dan.
Thank you. Thank you, both.

764
00:48:37,968 --> 00:48:39,433
Yeah?

765
00:48:39,435 --> 00:48:41,002
Hey, can you turn
your music down, please?

766
00:48:41,235 --> 00:48:42,967
'Cause I'm having
a really hard time.

767
00:48:42,969 --> 00:48:44,466
Whatever.

768
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,399
Yeah, sure, man. Yeah.

769
00:48:49,401 --> 00:48:50,602
- I'll just turn it right down. Sorry.
- Thank you. Thank you.

770
00:48:53,835 --> 00:48:56,335
I was troubled by

771
00:48:57,368 --> 00:48:58,968
what we've been doing.

772
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:00,767
I get it.

773
00:49:00,769 --> 00:49:02,035
I get it.

774
00:49:03,301 --> 00:49:04,734
We've all been troubled.

775
00:49:04,736 --> 00:49:07,302
It's the nature
of what we do.

776
00:49:08,935 --> 00:49:12,003
But I need you to tell me
who was here with you.

777
00:49:13,702 --> 00:49:15,002
I need that from you.

778
00:49:18,003 --> 00:49:20,534
I can't do that.

779
00:49:20,536 --> 00:49:23,970
We can't fix things
unless we begin with

780
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:26,269
your friend.

781
00:49:27,603 --> 00:49:29,334
The person who was here.

782
00:49:29,336 --> 00:49:30,636
Because they're gonna die.
They're in grave danger.

783
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:33,869
You know that, right?

784
00:49:33,871 --> 00:49:36,367
They're gonna die unless
we bring them back here,

785
00:49:36,369 --> 00:49:38,637
where you can help
to keep them alive.

786
00:49:41,669 --> 00:49:43,303
Hey. Dora.

787
00:49:44,903 --> 00:49:47,771
I promise, from here on in,
we will do things differently.

788
00:49:51,004 --> 00:49:52,303
Will you trust me?

789
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:00,835
Eddie Brock.

790
00:50:00,837 --> 00:50:02,004
- Eddie Brock?
- Mmm-hmm.

791
00:50:11,637 --> 00:50:13,338
You were our best.

792
00:50:13,937 --> 00:50:15,669
Open it.

793
00:50:19,805 --> 00:50:21,003
No! No!

794
00:50:21,005 --> 00:50:23,005
No! No! No!

795
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:29,605
<i>Do not open that door.</i>

796
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:32,436
Huh?

797
00:50:44,905 --> 00:50:46,971
Stay put.

798
00:50:46,973 --> 00:50:48,837
- Hey, Eddie.
- <i>Who the hell is this guy?</i>

799
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:51,039
I'm gonna need
Mr. Drake's property back.

800
00:50:51,305 --> 00:50:52,971
Whoa.

801
00:50:52,973 --> 00:50:55,737
- <i>What are you doing?</i>
- I'm, uh...

802
00:50:55,739 --> 00:50:57,437
I'm putting my hands up.

803
00:50:57,439 --> 00:50:59,737
<i>You are making us
look bad.</i>

804
00:50:59,739 --> 00:51:02,704
I...
No, I am not.

805
00:51:02,706 --> 00:51:04,006
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

806
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,637
- No, I'm not.
- <i>Yes, you are!</i>

807
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:07,338
- No, I'm not.
- <i>Why would you do that?</i>

808
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,337
'Cause it is
a very sensible thing to do.

809
00:51:09,339 --> 00:51:11,537
- Eddie...
- <i>I will take care of this myself.</i>

810
00:51:11,539 --> 00:51:13,437
- What?
- Eddie, where's the bug?

811
00:51:15,241 --> 00:51:16,039
Take him down.

812
00:51:27,406 --> 00:51:28,807
I'm so sorry
about your friends.

813
00:51:37,341 --> 00:51:40,007
- What is that?
- <i>Not "what." Who.</i>

814
00:51:41,707 --> 00:51:42,840
Oh.

815
00:51:52,341 --> 00:51:53,341
Shit.

816
00:52:15,242 --> 00:52:17,572
<i>Outstanding.</i>

817
00:52:17,574 --> 00:52:19,606
<i>Now let's bite all their heads off
and pile them up in the corner.</i>

818
00:52:19,608 --> 00:52:20,706
Why would we do that?

819
00:52:20,708 --> 00:52:23,509
<i>Pile of bodies, pile of heads.</i>

820
00:52:30,742 --> 00:52:32,342
What the shit, man?

821
00:52:38,009 --> 00:52:39,942
No! No, no, no!

822
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:48,740
- What the hell?
- Dude! How did you do that?

823
00:52:48,742 --> 00:52:51,009
Apparently, I have a parasite.

824
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:02,010
Mr. Drake, our subject
is carrying the Symbiote.

825
00:53:02,244 --> 00:53:03,676
<i>Connecting you
to the feed now.</i>

826
00:53:08,843 --> 00:53:10,541
He's achieved symbiosis.

827
00:53:10,543 --> 00:53:11,976
Are you seeing this?

828
00:53:11,978 --> 00:53:13,977
Are you seeing this?
He's achieved symbiosis!

829
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:16,975
Treece...

830
00:53:16,977 --> 00:53:18,978
Treece, bring me back
my creature.

831
00:53:27,444 --> 00:53:28,677
<i>Eddie.</i>

832
00:53:38,344 --> 00:53:40,709
You're not even here, are you?
I'm just seeing things.

833
00:53:40,711 --> 00:53:42,809
It's not real.
You're in my head.

834
00:53:42,811 --> 00:53:44,376
'Cause you're just a parasite.

835
00:53:44,378 --> 00:53:45,411
"Parasite"?

836
00:53:52,612 --> 00:53:54,678
You have a brain tumor, Eddie.

837
00:53:58,512 --> 00:54:00,643
I got him. He's in the alley
behind the Schueller Building.

838
00:54:00,645 --> 00:54:02,443
I am sorry that I
called you a parasite.

839
00:54:02,445 --> 00:54:04,843
We can discuss this
like two men.

840
00:54:04,845 --> 00:54:06,345
What is that? What is that?

841
00:54:14,779 --> 00:54:16,844
What?

842
00:54:16,846 --> 00:54:19,309
Do not let him get away.
Do you understand me, Treece?

843
00:54:19,311 --> 00:54:21,843
<i>Copy.
Weapons are armed and ready.</i>

844
00:54:21,845 --> 00:54:22,945
Launch the drones.

845
00:54:52,279 --> 00:54:54,410
<i>Duck.</i>

846
00:54:55,781 --> 00:54:57,411
Whew!

847
00:54:57,413 --> 00:54:59,313
- Thank you.
- <i>You are welcome.</i>

848
00:55:05,347 --> 00:55:07,514
Oh!

849
00:55:15,647 --> 00:55:18,014
This is beyond
anything we thought was possible.

850
00:55:24,848 --> 00:55:26,580
Oh, God, no!

851
00:55:48,782 --> 00:55:50,579
Holy shit!

852
00:55:57,815 --> 00:55:59,847
Treece, do not
let him get away.

853
00:55:59,849 --> 00:56:02,315
I've got him.
All ground vehicles, move in.

854
00:56:08,414 --> 00:56:10,549
Target is now eastbound
on Grant.

855
00:56:11,849 --> 00:56:13,349
Oh, God! Do something!

856
00:56:20,883 --> 00:56:21,883
What the...

857
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:30,850
Oh, yeah! We got more friends.
Awesome.

858
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:36,016
No, no, no! No, no!

859
00:56:39,383 --> 00:56:40,383
No! You're out of your mind!

860
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:44,784
No!

861
00:57:04,618 --> 00:57:06,584
- That is a dead-end!
- <i>Not for us.</i>

862
00:57:08,284 --> 00:57:10,384
Whoa!

863
00:57:16,551 --> 00:57:17,551
Yeah!

864
00:57:47,485 --> 00:57:48,652
Whoa!

865
00:57:55,485 --> 00:57:56,917
I am going to die!

866
00:57:56,919 --> 00:57:58,353
<i>You are not
going to die!</i>

867
00:58:10,419 --> 00:58:12,720
Whoa! That was pretty cool,
actually. I'm not gonna lie...

868
00:58:22,254 --> 00:58:23,518
I got him.

869
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,584
- <i>Bring him home.</i>
- Copy that.

870
00:58:24,586 --> 00:58:26,520
This is incredible.

871
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:35,719
You have been a serious
pain in the ass for me, Eddie.

872
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:38,754
Well, you know,
I aim to please.

873
00:58:50,554 --> 00:58:54,519
Eyes, lungs, pancreas.

874
00:58:54,521 --> 00:58:56,988
So many snacks,
so little time.

875
00:59:07,622 --> 00:59:09,552
SFPD. Don't move!

876
00:59:09,554 --> 00:59:10,721
Get off the car!

877
00:59:27,488 --> 00:59:28,523
My legs.

878
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:32,653
Oh, my God,
my legs were broken.

879
00:59:32,655 --> 00:59:35,055
Now they're not broken.
What is happening?

880
00:59:50,389 --> 00:59:52,320
What the hell
are you?

881
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:54,788
I am Venom.

882
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:57,554
And you are mine.

883
00:59:57,556 --> 00:59:59,921
You bit somebody's head off.

884
00:59:59,923 --> 01:00:01,989
Fuel in the tank.

885
01:00:01,991 --> 01:00:04,023
Listen carefully, Eddie.

886
01:00:04,258 --> 01:00:06,488
You did not find us.

887
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:09,057
We found you.

888
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:11,321
Think of yourself
as my ride.

889
01:00:11,323 --> 01:00:12,588
Where are you going?

890
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:15,688
We need
Carlton Drake's rocket.

891
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:17,655
You remember him.

892
01:00:17,657 --> 01:00:19,054
How do you even know
about that?

893
01:00:19,056 --> 01:00:21,555
- I know everything, Eddie.
- You do?

894
01:00:21,557 --> 01:00:23,388
- Everything about you.
- How?

895
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:25,822
I am inside your head.

896
01:00:25,824 --> 01:00:28,389
You are a loser, Eddie.

897
01:00:32,957 --> 01:00:35,723
Are you gonna eat
anybody else?

898
01:00:35,725 --> 01:00:37,022
Most likely.

899
01:00:37,024 --> 01:00:38,488
Oh, God.

900
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:41,489
That is why we are here.

901
01:00:41,491 --> 01:00:44,792
Cooperate,
and you might just survive.

902
01:00:45,958 --> 01:00:48,058
That is the deal.

903
01:00:51,558 --> 01:00:52,890
<i>Good
evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

904
01:00:52,892 --> 01:00:54,790
<i>Welcome to San Francisco.</i>

905
01:00:54,792 --> 01:00:56,691
<i>For your safety and comfort,
please remain seated...</i>

906
01:01:17,725 --> 01:01:19,490
Hey, babe. I'm almost home.

907
01:01:19,492 --> 01:01:21,322
- <i>Where's Eddie?</i>
- Why? What's happening?

908
01:01:21,324 --> 01:01:23,392
I got Eddie's labs back,

909
01:01:24,793 --> 01:01:26,724
and it's worse than I thought.

910
01:01:26,726 --> 01:01:29,891
His systems, renal, endocrine,
they're behaving abnormally.

911
01:01:29,893 --> 01:01:31,624
<i>I've never seen
anything like it.</i>

912
01:01:31,626 --> 01:01:33,423
What does that mean, Dan?
What are you telling me?

913
01:01:33,425 --> 01:01:35,059
- You need to get him here.
- <i>My God.</i>

914
01:01:39,027 --> 01:01:40,859
- <i>Eddie Brock here. Leave a message.</i>
- Shit.

915
01:01:47,393 --> 01:01:50,725
Where were you when
it left Dr. Skirth's body?

916
01:01:50,727 --> 01:01:52,892
- Where was he?
- I was...

917
01:01:52,894 --> 01:01:56,894
This is the higher life-form. You
stood by and watched while it died.

918
01:01:57,927 --> 01:01:58,960
The arrogance.

919
01:02:04,693 --> 01:02:08,926
Treece, listen to me. After this,
we can't risk killing Brock,

920
01:02:08,928 --> 01:02:11,060
not until we find
another suitable host.

921
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:15,691
I don't want to see you again
unless you have Brock!

922
01:02:20,394 --> 01:02:22,692
Officer, what's happening?
I need to get in there.

923
01:02:22,694 --> 01:02:24,793
- It's my friend's apartment.
- Building's been evacuated.

924
01:02:24,795 --> 01:02:25,859
It's not safe for you
to be here, ma'am.

925
01:02:25,861 --> 01:02:27,793
Found another one, Bill.

926
01:02:27,795 --> 01:02:29,692
Get off the streets.
Go home.

927
01:02:29,694 --> 01:02:31,392
There's bodies
all over the city tonight.

928
01:02:31,394 --> 01:02:32,427
Bodies?

929
01:02:33,861 --> 01:02:35,828
My God, Eddie,
where are you?

930
01:02:38,828 --> 01:02:40,793
<i>Who is Anne?
Your pulse has quickened.</i>

931
01:02:40,795 --> 01:02:42,727
That is none of your
goddamn business.

932
01:02:42,729 --> 01:02:45,062
<i>Everything of yours
is my business, Eddie.</i>

933
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:46,859
<i>We have no secrets.</i>

934
01:02:46,861 --> 01:02:48,493
Yeah? Well, then you know
exactly why I'm going here

935
01:02:48,495 --> 01:02:49,994
before we get to your rocket,
huh?

936
01:02:49,996 --> 01:02:53,527
<i>Sure.
I'm not unreasonable.</i>

937
01:02:53,529 --> 01:02:55,326
Shit. Yeah?

938
01:02:55,328 --> 01:02:57,062
Eddie. Thank God. Where are you?
I need to see you.

939
01:02:57,294 --> 01:02:59,027
No, no, you can't see me.

940
01:02:59,029 --> 01:03:01,326
Eddie, I need you to tell me where you are.
I'm coming to get you.

941
01:03:01,328 --> 01:03:02,894
No, you cannot come
anywhere near me.

942
01:03:02,896 --> 01:03:05,461
You cannot come
near me right now.

943
01:03:05,463 --> 01:03:07,029
- Richard. Hey, Richard...
- <i>No!</i>

944
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,760
- Eddie?
- <i>No, I gotta go up there.</i>

945
01:03:08,762 --> 01:03:09,794
You know you're not
supposed to be here, Eddie.

946
01:03:09,796 --> 01:03:11,062
I got to get up there, man.

947
01:03:11,296 --> 01:03:13,360
Look, I got love for you, bro,
but no can do.

948
01:03:13,362 --> 01:03:14,728
There's no such thing
as can't.

949
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:15,897
I'm sorry, man.

950
01:03:16,829 --> 01:03:19,327
Okay, okay... Uh...

951
01:03:19,329 --> 01:03:21,628
Can you, uh,
just give him this?

952
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:24,561
- He needs to see what's on it.
- Eddie, please. I really need this job.

953
01:03:24,563 --> 01:03:26,861
- <i>Let's eat his brains.</i>
- No! You do not touch him!

954
01:03:26,863 --> 01:03:28,861
- He is my friend.
- What's wrong with you?

955
01:03:28,863 --> 01:03:30,928
He works three jobs just so
that he can support his family.

956
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:32,427
- Eddie, what's going on?
- We're leaving.

957
01:03:32,429 --> 01:03:33,961
- <i>"We"?</i>
- Yeah.

958
01:03:33,963 --> 01:03:35,531
- What are you talking about, "we"?
- Just stay back!

959
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,563
Yeah.

960
01:03:45,429 --> 01:03:47,863
- Shit.
- <i>You want up?</i>

961
01:03:51,631 --> 01:03:53,964
<i>Well, why didn't you just say?</i>

962
01:04:04,764 --> 01:04:07,064
Hmm.

963
01:04:07,297 --> 01:04:10,495
- It is peaceful up here.
- <i>I'm not very good with heights.</i>

964
01:04:10,497 --> 01:04:14,696
Your world is not so ugly
after all.

965
01:04:14,698 --> 01:04:17,032
I'm almost sorry
to see it end.

966
01:04:17,266 --> 01:04:18,429
<i>What does that mean?</i>

967
01:04:26,698 --> 01:04:28,395
Where'd you go?
Where did you go?

968
01:04:39,298 --> 01:04:40,696
<i>I got us.</i>

969
01:04:40,698 --> 01:04:41,799
Whoa.

970
01:04:47,267 --> 01:04:50,831
Again?
You're gonna get me killed.

971
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:52,964
<i>You die, I die.</i>

972
01:04:52,966 --> 01:04:55,364
Yeah, well, you can always
just shed my carcass

973
01:04:55,366 --> 01:04:57,864
and exchange it for another
one whenever you need.

974
01:04:57,866 --> 01:04:59,764
<i>Why would I do that?</i>

975
01:04:59,766 --> 01:05:02,764
<i>You are far too good of a
match to throw away so soon.</i>

976
01:05:02,766 --> 01:05:04,931
<i>Plus, I am starting
to like you.</i>

977
01:05:04,933 --> 01:05:06,399
<i>You and I
are not so different.</i>

978
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,066
Thank you.

979
01:05:11,933 --> 01:05:12,966
Okay.

980
01:05:14,934 --> 01:05:16,432
Here's your evidence.

981
01:05:20,366 --> 01:05:21,566
<i>Jump.</i>

982
01:05:24,367 --> 01:05:25,732
<i>Pussy.</i>

983
01:05:35,834 --> 01:05:36,967
Hands!

984
01:05:38,901 --> 01:05:40,634
On the ground! Now!

985
01:05:45,035 --> 01:05:47,865
Guys, you do not want to do this.
Trust me.

986
01:05:47,867 --> 01:05:49,932
- Mask!
- Copy!

987
01:05:49,934 --> 01:05:52,431
All right,
have it your own way.

988
01:05:52,433 --> 01:05:54,068
- Mask!
- <i>Copy.</i>

989
01:05:54,301 --> 01:05:55,833
What the hell
is that thing?

990
01:06:01,434 --> 01:06:02,601
What the hell?

991
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:05,432
Hold your fire!

992
01:06:05,434 --> 01:06:07,566
Flares!

993
01:06:07,568 --> 01:06:08,666
He's there!
He's there!

994
01:06:08,668 --> 01:06:09,868
Reload!

995
01:06:10,968 --> 01:06:12,699
Anybody see him?

996
01:06:23,601 --> 01:06:25,534
Does anyone have eyes on him?

997
01:06:27,269 --> 01:06:29,369
<i>Switching to
thermal. Seeking target.</i>

998
01:06:42,969 --> 01:06:44,700
I don't have
eyes on him.

999
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:47,469
Where is it?

1000
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:55,568
Flash grenade!

1001
01:06:56,837 --> 01:06:57,968
Throw them!

1002
01:06:57,970 --> 01:06:59,500
Flash grenade!

1003
01:07:10,537 --> 01:07:11,802
He's in the rafters!

1004
01:07:11,804 --> 01:07:12,868
Above!

1005
01:07:18,304 --> 01:07:19,336
There he is!

1006
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:25,404
Move, move, move!

1007
01:07:55,338 --> 01:07:57,036
<i>No! We do not
eat policemen!</i>

1008
01:08:03,405 --> 01:08:04,904
Annie! Annie, wait!

1009
01:08:04,906 --> 01:08:06,736
- Wait, please.
- Oh, what the hell is that?

1010
01:08:06,738 --> 01:08:09,403
That's not me.
I've been infected.

1011
01:08:09,405 --> 01:08:11,870
- Eddie, what's happening?
- He's inside me.

1012
01:08:11,872 --> 01:08:13,470
- "He"?
- Yes.

1013
01:08:13,472 --> 01:08:15,904
- I know it sounds crazy, but...
- You're sick.

1014
01:08:15,906 --> 01:08:18,605
- Eddie, you're really sick.
- No, I am scared!

1015
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:23,672
- And I need help.
- Hospital.

1016
01:08:27,438 --> 01:08:28,438
Right now.

1017
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,436
I can't go with you.
It's not safe.

1018
01:08:34,438 --> 01:08:35,505
Get in the car, Eddie.

1019
01:08:37,606 --> 01:08:40,673
- In the back.
- <i>I like her. Get in.</i>

1020
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:49,840
I'm out of control.

1021
01:08:51,506 --> 01:08:53,006
Dan just needs to do
another MRI.

1022
01:08:53,008 --> 01:08:54,840
- <i>No MRI.</i>
- No. No. No MRI.

1023
01:08:55,541 --> 01:08:57,040
What? Why?

1024
01:08:57,274 --> 01:08:59,371
<i>Sound at 4,000
to 6,000 hertz is lethal.</i>

1025
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:04,705
Sound frequency in the MRI
is really harmful for him.

1026
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:07,505
What, so, sound
is like his kryptonite?

1027
01:09:07,507 --> 01:09:10,074
- Not all sounds.
- <i>And fire.</i>

1028
01:09:10,306 --> 01:09:13,340
Fire. And fire.
He's talking to you?

1029
01:09:14,941 --> 01:09:16,374
Always.

1030
01:09:17,474 --> 01:09:19,640
- Are you in pain?
- No.

1031
01:09:19,642 --> 01:09:22,338
No, I don't feel anything,
actually, apart from...

1032
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:24,639
I'm hungry all the time.

1033
01:09:24,641 --> 01:09:27,975
<i>And you feel sad, do you
not, Eddie, when you are with her?</i>

1034
01:09:29,276 --> 01:09:30,972
Get out of my head, man.

1035
01:09:30,974 --> 01:09:33,439
<i>You never apologized.</i>

1036
01:09:33,441 --> 01:09:36,042
<i>You might not live
to get another chance.</i>

1037
01:09:41,909 --> 01:09:43,739
Annie.

1038
01:09:43,741 --> 01:09:47,406
I just want to say
that whatever happens,

1039
01:09:47,408 --> 01:09:53,406
that I am truly sorry for whatever...
And everything I have ever done to you.

1040
01:09:53,408 --> 01:09:55,009
I am truly, truly sorry.

1041
01:09:56,408 --> 01:09:58,475
And that I love you.

1042
01:09:59,043 --> 01:10:01,673
Oh, Eddie...

1043
01:10:01,675 --> 01:10:04,774
Now's really not the time. Let's
just keep you alive, okay?

1044
01:10:04,776 --> 01:10:07,407
<i>Aw, that's nice.</i>

1045
01:10:10,609 --> 01:10:15,507
You know, I'm really wet and
cold. Can I, uh, wear this?

1046
01:10:15,509 --> 01:10:18,707
Yeah, yeah, you can wear
whatever you want.

1047
01:10:18,709 --> 01:10:19,776
Thank you.

1048
01:10:38,377 --> 01:10:39,410
Hello?

1049
01:10:50,610 --> 01:10:51,945
What are you doing here?

1050
01:10:55,644 --> 01:10:56,645
Are you lost?

1051
01:10:58,811 --> 01:11:00,811
I'm not lost.

1052
01:11:08,378 --> 01:11:09,876
Thanks for coming in.

1053
01:11:09,878 --> 01:11:13,376
- Eddie, I'm sorry.
- What?

1054
01:11:13,378 --> 01:11:16,044
Eddie, I got your labs back, and
your heart has atrophied severely.

1055
01:11:16,279 --> 01:11:18,776
<i>Do not listen to him.
I can fix it.</i>

1056
01:11:18,778 --> 01:11:20,078
I don't want you to fix it.

1057
01:11:20,311 --> 01:11:21,643
<i>I can heal you.</i>

1058
01:11:23,845 --> 01:11:25,544
Can you fix it?

1059
01:11:25,546 --> 01:11:27,476
No. I've never seen
anything like this before.

1060
01:11:27,478 --> 01:11:29,676
- This parasite, whatever this is...
- <i>"Parasite"?</i>

1061
01:11:29,678 --> 01:11:30,976
It's eating you
from the inside.

1062
01:11:30,978 --> 01:11:32,610
Not a parasite.
He's not.

1063
01:11:32,612 --> 01:11:34,710
- You're using him up.
- <i>No. She is wrong.</i>

1064
01:11:34,712 --> 01:11:37,743
- We need to get you to the ICU.
- Wait. Shh!

1065
01:11:37,745 --> 01:11:40,342
- I, Eddie, am I dying?
- <i>No!</i>

1066
01:11:40,344 --> 01:11:41,944
You're killing him.

1067
01:11:41,946 --> 01:11:43,410
<i>They do not know
what they are talking about.</i>

1068
01:11:43,412 --> 01:11:44,976
Listen,
we don't have a lot of time...

1069
01:11:44,978 --> 01:11:46,510
- Oh, God!
- <i>We have to get out of here.</i>

1070
01:11:47,846 --> 01:11:48,911
- Stop!
- Oh, God, he's killing you.

1071
01:11:48,913 --> 01:11:50,046
I'm killing you.
I'm so sorry.

1072
01:11:52,612 --> 01:11:55,612
No! Don't do that!

1073
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:13,811
Are you all right? Eddie, I'm sorry.
I had to get him out of you.

1074
01:12:13,813 --> 01:12:15,080
What is that?

1075
01:12:22,047 --> 01:12:25,012
You were killing me?

1076
01:12:25,014 --> 01:12:28,080
What happened to "we," man?
What happened to "we"?

1077
01:12:29,914 --> 01:12:34,580
Yeah, look at you now, huh?
Now you're dying, too.

1078
01:12:35,814 --> 01:12:36,947
We're done.

1079
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:41,679
- Where do you think you're going?
- Anywhere other than here.

1080
01:12:41,681 --> 01:12:43,445
You don't think we have
a little problem on our hands?

1081
01:12:43,447 --> 01:12:45,447
Wait, you're not gonna
leave me here with this thing.

1082
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:49,913
You want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

1083
01:12:49,915 --> 01:12:53,813
I do. And you're right.
We do need to talk about it,

1084
01:12:53,815 --> 01:12:56,046
but I don't know
much more than you do.

1085
01:12:56,048 --> 01:12:59,014
I guess he had
no one else to turn to.

1086
01:12:59,016 --> 01:13:02,746
He's a very complicated man.
But, Dan, I promise,

1087
01:13:02,748 --> 01:13:04,479
there's nothing going on
between me and Eddie.

1088
01:13:04,481 --> 01:13:06,612
I'm not talking
about you and Eddie, Anne.

1089
01:13:06,614 --> 01:13:07,881
- Oh.
- I'm talking about that.

1090
01:13:11,682 --> 01:13:12,681
Dan.

1091
01:13:19,514 --> 01:13:20,748
Where is it?

1092
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:48,650
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

1093
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:18,447
You can kill me,
'cause I'm dying anyway.

1094
01:14:18,449 --> 01:14:23,048
I'm not just gonna kill you.
That wouldn't be any fun.

1095
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:27,084
No, no, no. I'm gonna rip your
tongue out of your face.

1096
01:14:27,317 --> 01:14:29,615
Whoo!

1097
01:14:31,285 --> 01:14:34,950
Stop. You're bleeding
all over my lab. Go. Go!

1098
01:14:44,518 --> 01:14:46,583
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1099
01:14:46,585 --> 01:14:49,615
And you know what? Even if I
did, I wouldn't tell you anyway.

1100
01:14:49,617 --> 01:14:53,516
I don't trust you,
and you're insane.

1101
01:14:53,518 --> 01:14:55,448
- That hurts.
- Sorry.

1102
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:56,917
Long journal entry
about that tonight.

1103
01:14:56,919 --> 01:14:58,683
You're being dumb, Brock.
I'm not insane.

1104
01:14:58,685 --> 01:15:01,850
What's insane is the way
humans choose to live today.

1105
01:15:01,852 --> 01:15:04,416
Think about it.
All we do is take, take, take.

1106
01:15:04,418 --> 01:15:05,850
It can't go on.

1107
01:15:05,852 --> 01:15:08,384
We've brought the planet
to the brink of extinction.

1108
01:15:08,386 --> 01:15:10,383
We're parasites.
You're a good example.

1109
01:15:10,385 --> 01:15:12,053
Think about it.
All you do is take.

1110
01:15:12,286 --> 01:15:15,983
You took my Symbiote. You
take potshots at a great man

1111
01:15:15,985 --> 01:15:17,784
- trying to get something done.
- Who?

1112
01:15:19,718 --> 01:15:21,983
Didn't you take from the
person you loved the most,

1113
01:15:21,985 --> 01:15:24,484
who trusted you the most?
That's insane.

1114
01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:28,984
What I've initiated is a whole
new world, a new species.

1115
01:15:28,986 --> 01:15:31,417
Man and Symbiote combined.

1116
01:15:31,419 --> 01:15:33,984
Let me tell you something, buddy.
All right? Just man-to-man.

1117
01:15:33,986 --> 01:15:37,051
Because I have spent a significant
amount of time, all right,

1118
01:15:37,053 --> 01:15:40,450
with one of these creatures
up my ass.

1119
01:15:40,452 --> 01:15:41,751
It's not a lot of fun.

1120
01:15:41,753 --> 01:15:44,351
And then I find out,
all along,

1121
01:15:44,353 --> 01:15:45,752
that they're killing you.

1122
01:15:45,754 --> 01:15:47,484
This is the last time
I'm asking you.

1123
01:15:47,486 --> 01:15:50,019
- Where is my Symbiote?
- I have no idea.

1124
01:15:50,021 --> 01:15:52,552
- Where is he?
- Oh, my God!

1125
01:15:52,554 --> 01:15:54,054
Where's Venom?

1126
01:15:54,287 --> 01:15:57,851
That is the ugliest-looking
thing I have ever seen.

1127
01:16:03,921 --> 01:16:07,718
You know, Brock,
I have no use for you.

1128
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:10,385
Treece! Come and clean up
your mess.

1129
01:16:10,387 --> 01:16:14,618
Whoa, he has one
up his ass, too.

1130
01:16:22,855 --> 01:16:28,055
Your friends, the others, I apologize.
I tried to keep them alive.

1131
01:16:28,289 --> 01:16:31,686
There are more of us.
Millions more.

1132
01:16:31,688 --> 01:16:33,888
They will follow
wherever I lead.

1133
01:16:35,922 --> 01:16:37,686
Where we lead.

1134
01:16:37,688 --> 01:16:39,419
Yes, "we."

1135
01:16:39,421 --> 01:16:42,688
But first,
we must retrieve them.

1136
01:16:44,055 --> 01:16:45,622
I can take care of that.

1137
01:16:50,655 --> 01:16:53,654
Yeah, what you gonna do,
you gonna walk me to death?

1138
01:16:53,656 --> 01:16:54,656
Shut up.

1139
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:00,089
Not so tough
without your friend.

1140
01:17:04,989 --> 01:17:06,656
Did your mama not love you?

1141
01:17:09,557 --> 01:17:11,021
God damn it!

1142
01:17:12,889 --> 01:17:16,054
I guess it
pays to be a specialist, huh?

1143
01:17:16,056 --> 01:17:18,055
You know, it doesn't matter
if you kill me anyway,

1144
01:17:18,057 --> 01:17:19,821
because there's something
way bigger afoot

1145
01:17:19,823 --> 01:17:20,889
in this world than you and me.

1146
01:17:21,823 --> 01:17:24,055
Much bigger than me.

1147
01:17:24,057 --> 01:17:28,557
And it's much,
much bigger than you.

1148
01:17:30,924 --> 01:17:32,755
Karma's a bitch.

1149
01:17:32,757 --> 01:17:33,990
I don't believe in karma.

1150
01:17:35,723 --> 01:17:37,723
Oh! Ooh!

1151
01:17:42,423 --> 01:17:43,488
Hi, Eddie.

1152
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:45,522
Whoa. Whoa...

1153
01:17:45,524 --> 01:17:48,354
Oh...

1154
01:17:48,356 --> 01:17:49,356
Mmm...

1155
01:17:50,391 --> 01:17:51,591
Mmm!

1156
01:18:07,825 --> 01:18:08,991
Oh, no.

1157
01:18:10,591 --> 01:18:12,989
I just bit
that guy's head off.

1158
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:15,490
I know, I know. I've been there, too.
It's not fun.

1159
01:18:15,492 --> 01:18:18,091
- <i>The one with Drake is Riot.</i>
- Who's Riot?

1160
01:18:18,324 --> 01:18:20,823
<i>Riot is what you would call
a team leader.</i>

1161
01:18:20,825 --> 01:18:22,889
<i>He has an arsenal of weapons.</i>

1162
01:18:22,891 --> 01:18:25,092
- Drake's got his own Symbiote.
- <i>He is unstoppable.</i>

1163
01:18:25,324 --> 01:18:26,889
- Oh, great.
- <i>We have got to go!</i>

1164
01:18:26,891 --> 01:18:28,590
Go where? Where we going?

1165
01:18:28,592 --> 01:18:30,024
- Well, I'm coming with you.
- <i>No!</i>

1166
01:18:30,026 --> 01:18:31,924
<i>It's going to get ugly.</i>

1167
01:18:31,926 --> 01:18:34,026
- Well, she can fight ugly. Trust me.
- Yeah, I can fight ugly.

1168
01:18:35,792 --> 01:18:37,358
Not today.

1169
01:18:38,826 --> 01:18:40,425
Oh, that's bullshit!

1170
01:18:42,592 --> 01:18:44,092
This is not a simulation.

1171
01:18:44,326 --> 01:18:46,490
Well, the flight team
aren't prepped yet.

1172
01:18:46,492 --> 01:18:48,925
I'll be piloting
the spacecraft.

1173
01:18:48,927 --> 01:18:50,657
- You?
- Yes, me.

1174
01:18:50,659 --> 01:18:52,357
How long?

1175
01:18:52,359 --> 01:18:54,057
We're loading the probe
and running diagnostics.

1176
01:18:54,059 --> 01:18:57,426
But even fully automated, you
can't pilot that craft all alone.

1177
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:00,760
I'm not alone.

1178
01:19:04,393 --> 01:19:07,691
God damn it! What the hell
happened there? We just left Annie.

1179
01:19:07,693 --> 01:19:09,658
<i>It is not safe for her.</i>

1180
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:11,060
<i>If we do not stop Riot,</i>

1181
01:19:11,294 --> 01:19:14,691
<i>he will come back here
with millions more of my kind.</i>

1182
01:19:14,693 --> 01:19:19,059
Millions? What, you were
gonna take the rocket,

1183
01:19:19,061 --> 01:19:21,093
and you were gonna come back
here with an invasion force?

1184
01:19:21,327 --> 01:19:23,025
Then what were you gonna do,
you were gonna go feed

1185
01:19:23,027 --> 01:19:24,792
- on a whole planet?
- <i>Yes!</i>

1186
01:19:24,794 --> 01:19:26,992
<i>But it is
different now, Eddie.</i>

1187
01:19:26,994 --> 01:19:29,559
- <i>I have decided to stay.</i>
- Wow!

1188
01:19:29,561 --> 01:19:32,591
<i>On my planet, I am
kind of a loser, like you.</i>

1189
01:19:32,593 --> 01:19:35,094
- <i>But here, we could be more.</i>
- Excuse me?

1190
01:19:35,327 --> 01:19:37,059
<i>And I'm getting to
like it here.</i>

1191
01:19:37,061 --> 01:19:39,725
Oh, you like us now,
do you, huh?

1192
01:19:39,727 --> 01:19:42,358
<i>However, there will be nothing left to
like if we do not stop that rocket.</i>

1193
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:46,094
Oh, I see. Right. When it comes
to being completely annihilated,

1194
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:48,458
- then it's back to "we."
- <i>It is "we."</i>

1195
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:50,859
<i>Like it or not, it is
going to take both of us.</i>

1196
01:19:50,861 --> 01:19:52,560
Hey, come on, man.
Cut the bullshit.

1197
01:19:52,562 --> 01:19:54,028
What really made you
change your mind?

1198
01:19:57,828 --> 01:20:00,795
You. You did, Eddie.

1199
01:20:02,795 --> 01:20:05,459
Scrub diagnostics.

1200
01:20:05,461 --> 01:20:07,829
- Sir?
- Did you hear me? Initiate the launch.

1201
01:20:14,528 --> 01:20:17,593
<i>T-minus
five minutes to launch.</i>

1202
01:20:17,595 --> 01:20:19,929
<i>Auto sequence has been
initiated.</i>

1203
01:20:32,628 --> 01:20:33,996
Oh, shit.

1204
01:20:43,563 --> 01:20:46,496
<i>T-minus
four minutes, 30 seconds.</i>

1205
01:20:53,963 --> 01:20:57,727
<i>Oh, Jesus!
You can take this guy, right?</i>

1206
01:20:57,729 --> 01:21:00,427
He has got shit
you have never seen.

1207
01:21:00,429 --> 01:21:02,527
<i>What does that mean?
What are our chances?</i>

1208
01:21:02,529 --> 01:21:05,961
Hmm. Pretty much zero.

1209
01:21:05,963 --> 01:21:08,864
<i>Oh, fuck it. Well,
let's go save the planet.</i>

1210
01:21:11,864 --> 01:21:13,964
<i>T-minus four minutes.</i>

1211
01:21:17,664 --> 01:21:20,463
<i>Initiate orbiter
aerosurface profile.</i>

1212
01:21:23,731 --> 01:21:26,562
Venom. Get in the rocket.

1213
01:21:26,564 --> 01:21:30,696
No. We won't let you destroy
this world.

1214
01:21:30,698 --> 01:21:32,030
Then die.

1215
01:21:42,765 --> 01:21:44,763
- <i>Holy shit!</i>
- Told you.

1216
01:21:44,765 --> 01:21:46,398
<i>T-minus three minutes.</i>

1217
01:21:58,832 --> 01:22:00,364
You have a strong host.

1218
01:22:02,631 --> 01:22:03,965
But not strong enough.

1219
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:45,430
<i>T-minus
two minutes, 30 seconds.</i>

1220
01:22:47,633 --> 01:22:48,767
Eddie.

1221
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:54,667
Drake, stop!

1222
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:03,336
Told you I could fight ugly.

1223
01:24:10,469 --> 01:24:12,770
<i>T-minus one minute.</i>

1224
01:24:30,737 --> 01:24:32,434
You're too late.

1225
01:24:32,436 --> 01:24:33,436
This is the next stage...

1226
01:24:35,504 --> 01:24:37,737
You talk too much.

1227
01:24:47,337 --> 01:24:49,070
<i>T-minus 30 seconds.</i>

1228
01:24:49,305 --> 01:24:50,938
You are nothing.

1229
01:25:19,572 --> 01:25:20,872
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

1230
01:25:21,638 --> 01:25:22,772
<i>Nine...</i>

1231
01:25:23,605 --> 01:25:24,672
<i>Eight...</i>

1232
01:25:25,605 --> 01:25:26,605
<i>Seven...</i>

1233
01:25:27,371 --> 01:25:28,371
<i>Six...</i>

1234
01:25:28,905 --> 01:25:29,939
<i>Five...</i>

1235
01:25:30,739 --> 01:25:32,369
<i>Four...</i>

1236
01:25:32,371 --> 01:25:33,903
<i>Three...</i>

1237
01:25:33,905 --> 01:25:35,770
<i>Two...</i>

1238
01:25:35,772 --> 01:25:37,773
<i>One...</i>

1239
01:25:39,572 --> 01:25:40,738
<i>Liftoff.</i>

1240
01:25:48,073 --> 01:25:49,704
Traitor!

1241
01:25:49,706 --> 01:25:51,471
Have a nice life.

1242
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:19,106
<i>Goodbye, Eddie.</i>

1243
01:26:20,373 --> 01:26:21,807
Venom, no!

1244
01:27:09,979 --> 01:27:13,477
Hmm. You're in luck. I've
decided to work pro bono.

1245
01:27:13,479 --> 01:27:15,477
I'm joining
the public defenders' office.

1246
01:27:15,479 --> 01:27:17,442
You're a good person, Annie.

1247
01:27:17,444 --> 01:27:18,944
What about you?
What are you gonna do?

1248
01:27:18,946 --> 01:27:20,777
Uh, the network asked me
to bring the show back,

1249
01:27:20,779 --> 01:27:22,811
and they want to start
with a piece on Drake.

1250
01:27:22,813 --> 01:27:24,911
Oh, wow, really?
So, what did you say?

1251
01:27:24,913 --> 01:27:29,344
Uh, I'm not into it. I want to
concentrate on the written word.

1252
01:27:29,346 --> 01:27:31,444
I scored the interview
of a lifetime.

1253
01:27:31,446 --> 01:27:33,778
- Oh, yeah? Who?
- You're gonna have to read it.

1254
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:36,411
Oh! Like everyone else.

1255
01:27:36,413 --> 01:27:37,413
Yeah.

1256
01:27:39,847 --> 01:27:42,080
Hey, I'm sorry about Venom.

1257
01:27:43,779 --> 01:27:44,979
Hey, um...

1258
01:27:47,647 --> 01:27:49,478
Do you want to talk
about that kiss?

1259
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:52,680
Oh, that? You call that a kiss...
No, that was...

1260
01:27:54,313 --> 01:27:58,046
Uh, that was your
buddy's idea.

1261
01:27:58,048 --> 01:28:00,447
Oh, right. Well,
that is good to know.

1262
01:28:02,947 --> 01:28:05,314
- It did feel kind of great, though.
- What?

1263
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:07,379
I mean, the...

1264
01:28:07,381 --> 01:28:10,913
- The power?
- Yeah. When it's, you know...

1265
01:28:10,915 --> 01:28:12,479
- Inside you?
- You know what I mean.

1266
01:28:12,481 --> 01:28:13,581
Okay.

1267
01:28:14,881 --> 01:28:16,479
- Hey, Eddie?
- Mmm-hmm?

1268
01:28:16,481 --> 01:28:18,712
We're not gonna
tell Dan about this. Okay?

1269
01:28:18,714 --> 01:28:22,445
<i>Look at her. She has no
idea we are going to get her back.</i>

1270
01:28:22,447 --> 01:28:25,379
No, I don't think so.

1271
01:28:25,381 --> 01:28:27,846
- Sorry, what was that?
- We're not gonna tell Dan.

1272
01:28:27,848 --> 01:28:29,646
Eddie, is there something
you want to tell me?

1273
01:28:29,648 --> 01:28:32,048
- Nope.
- <i>You belong with us, Annie.</i>

1274
01:28:32,282 --> 01:28:33,814
Eddie, are you sure?

1275
01:28:33,816 --> 01:28:35,813
Good Lord, look at that.

1276
01:28:35,815 --> 01:28:37,948
- Look at the time.
- I have to go.

1277
01:28:39,715 --> 01:28:41,880
- Hey, it's nice seeing you.
- Yeah.

1278
01:28:41,882 --> 01:28:44,015
You take care, all right?

1279
01:28:44,283 --> 01:28:46,082
- Yeah, you take care of yourself.
- Bye.

1280
01:28:50,016 --> 01:28:53,446
Hey. Don't give up on her.

1281
01:28:53,448 --> 01:28:54,615
Either of you.

1282
01:28:55,348 --> 01:28:56,713
We won't.

1283
01:28:56,715 --> 01:28:58,413
- <i>Who is that guy?</i>
- Okay.

1284
01:28:58,415 --> 01:29:00,980
<i>Wait.
This thing looks delicious.</i>

1285
01:29:00,982 --> 01:29:03,647
I have absolutely no problem
with you sticking around,

1286
01:29:03,649 --> 01:29:06,580
but if you do, we're gonna have to
have some ground rules, all right?

1287
01:29:06,582 --> 01:29:10,346
You cannot just go around eating
anybody that you want to.

1288
01:29:10,348 --> 01:29:12,083
- <i>I cannot?</i>
- No, you cannot.

1289
01:29:12,316 --> 01:29:14,014
All right, we need to...
We need to reiterate this.

1290
01:29:14,016 --> 01:29:17,581
There are good people
in this world, a lot of them.

1291
01:29:17,583 --> 01:29:19,881
And then there are bad people.

1292
01:29:19,883 --> 01:29:21,748
You have to tell
the difference.

1293
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:25,614
The deal is, you will only
ever be allowed to touch,

1294
01:29:25,616 --> 01:29:28,981
harm, hurt, possibly,
very possibly,

1295
01:29:28,983 --> 01:29:31,414
eat very, very bad people,

1296
01:29:31,416 --> 01:29:34,083
but never, ever,
ever good people. All right?

1297
01:29:34,316 --> 01:29:36,681
- <i>Fine.</i>
- Good.

1298
01:29:36,683 --> 01:29:38,448
<i>But how does one
tell the difference?</i>

1299
01:29:38,450 --> 01:29:40,548
Well, it's super simple.

1300
01:29:40,550 --> 01:29:43,448
I mean, you just have to... You
can intuit it, you can sense it.

1301
01:29:43,450 --> 01:29:45,515
Sometimes you can
even feel it.

1302
01:29:45,517 --> 01:29:46,949
<i>Whatever you say.</i>

1303
01:29:46,951 --> 01:29:49,016
<i>But can we get something to
eat now?</i>

1304
01:29:49,018 --> 01:29:54,447
<i>Otherwise, your liver, it's starting
to look really, really good and juicy.</i>

1305
01:29:54,449 --> 01:29:56,751
Yeah. Definitely.
I know a place down here.

1306
01:29:58,317 --> 01:30:00,617
Hey, Mrs. C.

1307
01:30:01,684 --> 01:30:03,382
How you doing, Eddie?

1308
01:30:03,384 --> 01:30:04,950
Ain't nothing changed
but the weather. You know.

1309
01:30:04,952 --> 01:30:07,916
No.

1310
01:30:07,918 --> 01:30:11,052
So, what culinary delights will
tickle the pickle tonight?

1311
01:30:11,285 --> 01:30:12,949
<i>Tater tots
and chocolate.</i>

1312
01:30:12,951 --> 01:30:14,616
Right. Okay, no problem.

1313
01:30:15,885 --> 01:30:17,450
The payment's due, Chen.

1314
01:30:18,952 --> 01:30:20,949
Please.
I can't keep doing this.

1315
01:30:20,951 --> 01:30:22,516
Now.

1316
01:30:22,518 --> 01:30:24,085
- <i>Bad guy, right?</i>
- Yep.

1317
01:30:31,618 --> 01:30:33,683
You come in here again...

1318
01:30:33,685 --> 01:30:38,349
In fact, you go anywhere in this
city, preying on innocent people,

1319
01:30:38,351 --> 01:30:41,850
and we will find you
and eat both your arms

1320
01:30:41,852 --> 01:30:43,850
- and then both of your legs.
- No, no.

1321
01:30:43,852 --> 01:30:46,918
And then we will eat your face right
off your head. Do you understand?

1322
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:48,818
- Please...
- Yes.

1323
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:52,717
So, you will be this armless,
legless, faceless thing, won't you,

1324
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:57,484
rolling down the street,
like a turd in the wind?

1325
01:30:57,486 --> 01:30:59,853
- Do you feel me?
- What the hell are you?

1326
01:31:01,753 --> 01:31:04,319
We are Venom.

1327
01:31:05,853 --> 01:31:07,920
- On second thought...
- Please.

1328
01:31:14,986 --> 01:31:17,384
Eddie? What was that?

1329
01:31:17,386 --> 01:31:18,784
Oh...

1330
01:31:18,786 --> 01:31:22,587
I have a parasite. Yeah.
Night, Mrs. Chen.

1331
01:31:23,921 --> 01:31:25,451
- <i>"Parasite"?</i>
- Yeah.

1332
01:31:25,453 --> 01:31:27,451
It's a term of endearment,
that's all.

1333
01:31:27,453 --> 01:31:29,451
- <i>Apologize!</i>
- No.

1334
01:31:29,453 --> 01:31:32,385
- <i>Apologize!</i>
- All right, fine.

1335
01:31:32,387 --> 01:31:35,088
I'm sorry. So, what do you
want to do now?

1336
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:39,451
<i>The way I see it,
we can do whatever we want.</i>

1337
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:08,523
I need you
to stay quiet.

1338
01:34:08,525 --> 01:34:11,490
This is a "me" thing.
It is not a "we" thing.

1339
01:34:11,492 --> 01:34:14,625
- You got that?
- <i>Fine, but make it quick.</i>

1340
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:20,524
Open on five.

1341
01:34:20,526 --> 01:34:23,658
Go. Opening up.

1342
01:34:25,725 --> 01:34:28,424
You ask me, they're dumb
to let him call the shots.

1343
01:34:28,426 --> 01:34:30,958
Second he asked
for you to interview him,

1344
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:32,690
I'd have shut that
shit down.

1345
01:34:32,692 --> 01:34:34,858
Oh, yeah, you know the FBI.
They're just taking advantage

1346
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:37,491
of the one and only time
he'll ever speak to anyone.

1347
01:34:37,493 --> 01:34:40,624
They're hoping that I might help them
identify some additional bodies.

1348
01:34:40,626 --> 01:34:44,060
FBI don't work up close
and personal with him.

1349
01:34:44,294 --> 01:34:47,760
The FBI will have to identify you,
if you don't follow the rules.

1350
01:34:50,827 --> 01:34:53,727
Hey, Red!
I got a visitor for you.

1351
01:35:13,861 --> 01:35:16,492
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hey.

1352
01:35:16,494 --> 01:35:20,926
Do you mind if we forego the whole
creepy serial killer thing here?

1353
01:35:20,928 --> 01:35:22,094
Sure, it's good with me.

1354
01:35:22,327 --> 01:35:24,659
I mean, I can turn it on
if you want.

1355
01:35:24,661 --> 01:35:31,525
I can talk about the Dadaist
patterns of arterial spray.

1356
01:35:31,527 --> 01:35:33,593
I bet you can.

1357
01:35:33,595 --> 01:35:36,062
Tough to see you
in this light, Eddie.

1358
01:35:36,895 --> 01:35:37,929
Come on over.

1359
01:35:38,895 --> 01:35:40,361
All right.

1360
01:35:45,395 --> 01:35:46,693
I'm here.

1361
01:35:46,695 --> 01:35:50,427
When I get out of here,
and I will,

1362
01:35:51,762 --> 01:35:53,729
there's gonna be carnage.

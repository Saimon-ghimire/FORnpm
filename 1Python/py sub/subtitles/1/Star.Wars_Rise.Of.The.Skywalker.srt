1
00:00:02,797 --> 00:00:07,797
PRINCE ROGUE {PRAT3!K}

2
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:55,936
At last.

3
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,615
Snoke trained you well.

4
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,451
I killed Snoke.

5
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,386
I'll kill you.

6
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:16,290
My boy.

7
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:20,027
I made Snoke.

8
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,897
I have been every voice...

9
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:26,697
you have ever heard...

10
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,103
<i>inside your head.</i>

11
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:48,120
The First Order
was just the beginning.

12
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:52,690
I will give you
so much more.

13
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,426
You'll die first.

14
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:57,064
I have died before.

15
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:01,699
The dark side of the Force
is a pathway...

16
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:05,973
to many abilities
some consider to be...

17
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:09,642
unnatural.

18
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,122
What could you give me?

19
00:05:22,223 --> 00:05:23,858
Everything.

20
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,729
A new Empire.

21
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:58,123
<i>The might of the Final Order
will soon be ready.</i>

22
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:02,363
<i>It will be yours
if you do as I ask.</i>

23
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:06,265
Kill the girl!

24
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:08,033
End the Jedi...

25
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:12,406
and become what your
grandfather Vader could not.

26
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:19,411
You will rule
all the galaxy...

27
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:22,216
as the new emperor.

28
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,750
But beware...

29
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,988
she is not
who you think she is.

30
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:33,559
Who is she?

31
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:58,385
Are you ever gonna go?

32
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,855
- He can't beat us every time.
- Apparently he does.

33
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,123
How does he do it?

34
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,325
This guy right here?
It's 'cause he cheats.

35
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:08,193
I'm kidding!

36
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:09,528
- Oh, come on. Take your turn.
- You're 250 years old.

37
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,963
You're taking forever.
That's cheating.

38
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:12,264
Of course
you're better than us.

39
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,365
That's why we think
you're cheating.

40
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:17,536
- Don't worry!
- We're not gonna turn it off.

41
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,507
- He's cheating.
- Definitely.

42
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,875
Klaud, I hope
you fixed that surge.

43
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:32,783
T-minus five.

44
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,054
Artoo.

45
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,201
Boolio, good to see you.
You got something for us?

46
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:52,206
From a new ally!
A spy in the First Order!

47
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:55,340
A spy? Who?

48
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:56,575
I don't know!

49
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:59,779
Transfer the message!
Get it to Leia, hurry!

50
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,582
This could be big, Artoo.

51
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:15,827
<i>Locked on target.</i>

52
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,562
Finn, we're about
to be cooked!

53
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:18,830
We're almost there!

54
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:21,800
Poe, we got it.

55
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,268
How do we thank you?

56
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,039
Win the war!

57
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,914
Sorry, I'm sorry! I know!

58
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:45,392
Finn, you're supposed to be
getting rid of those things!

59
00:08:46,427 --> 00:08:47,428
Ooh!

60
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,762
- I got one!
- How many are left?

61
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:51,963
Too many.

62
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:54,032
What?

63
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,271
Good thinking, Chewie.

64
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:00,939
Finn, we can boulder
these TIEs!

65
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,509
I was just thinking that.

66
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,521
Ha!

67
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,590
<i>Get us back to base!</i>

68
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:20,325
How thick do you think
that ice wall is?

69
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,473
- Poe!
- I know, I know!

70
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:37,876
What are you doing?

71
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:39,611
Lightspeed skipping.

72
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,315
How do you know
how to do that?

73
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:49,154
Yeah, well,
Rey's not here, is she?

74
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,864
Last jump, maybe forever.

75
00:09:57,866 --> 00:10:00,000
Hold on!

76
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,249
Be with me.

77
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,020
Be with me.

78
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:23,924
Be with me.

79
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,095
They're not with me. Ugh.

80
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,567
Rey.

81
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:36,836
Be patient.

82
00:10:36,838 --> 00:10:38,570
I'm starting to
think it isn't possible...

83
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:41,139
to hear voices of the Jedi
who came before.

84
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,074
Nothing's impossible.

85
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,509
Nothing's impossible.

86
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:46,346
I'm gonna run
the training course.

87
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,209
<i>No!</i>

88
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:25,277
Join me.

89
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,078
<i>Join me.</i>

90
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,713
<i>Ben, no!</i>

91
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:29,781
<i>You killed him!</i>

92
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:31,285
Ben!

93
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:46,099
BB-8,
I'm so sorry.

94
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,871
I didn't finish
the training course.

95
00:12:51,873 --> 00:12:53,373
Got distracted.

96
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:01,047
I'm just
not feeling myself.

97
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:03,248
I know it looks...

98
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,417
It looks like
I'm making excuses.

99
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:07,053
Don't tell me
what things look like.

100
00:13:07,055 --> 00:13:08,422
Tell me what they are.

101
00:13:10,424 --> 00:13:13,193
I think I'm just tired.
That's all.

102
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:15,962
General...

103
00:13:15,964 --> 00:13:18,129
the <i>Falcon</i>
still hasn't arrived.

104
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,801
Commander's asking
for guidance.

105
00:13:23,704 --> 00:13:26,171
I will earn
your brother's saber...

106
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:27,541
one day.

107
00:13:30,444 --> 00:13:32,677
No, you can't do it for me.

108
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,248
Never underestimate
a droid.

109
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,252
Yes, Master.

110
00:13:47,996 --> 00:13:49,761
Rey!

111
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:51,198
<i>Falcon's</i> back!

112
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:54,466
Come on, get over here!

113
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:55,901
I need a fire crew here!

114
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:58,269
And another one in the back!
Go, go!

115
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,138
Coming!

116
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,206
It's on fire!

117
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:04,110
Whole thing's on fire.
All of it.

118
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:05,377
- It's on fire.
- Hey.

119
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:06,745
- Hey!
- There's a spy?

120
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:08,814
Really could have used
your help out there.

121
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:09,748
How'd it go?

122
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,583
Really bad, actually.
Really bad.

123
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:13,585
- Han's ship...
- What'd you do to the droid?

124
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,021
What'd you do
to the <i>Falcon?</i>

125
00:14:15,023 --> 00:14:16,521
The <i>Falcon</i> in
a lot better shape than he is.

126
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,756
BB-8's not on fire.

127
00:14:17,758 --> 00:14:19,391
What's left of him
isn't on fire.

128
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:20,692
- Tell me what happened.
- You tell me first.

129
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,193
- You know what you are?
- What?

130
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,628
You're difficult.
Really difficult.

131
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,064
- You're a difficult man.
- You, you are...

132
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:26,765
- Rey.
- Finn. Oh.

133
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:28,299
You made it back.

134
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:29,668
Yeah. Barely.

135
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,837
- So, bad mood?
- Me?

136
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,407
- Him.
- Always.

137
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:35,306
Do we have a spy?

138
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,175
Well...

139
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:38,677
You lightspeed skipped?

140
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:39,912
Yeah, well, it got us
back here, didn't it?

141
00:14:39,914 --> 00:14:41,346
Poe, the compressor's down.

142
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:42,747
- Oh, I know, I was there.
- Every time.

143
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:44,050
You can't lightspeed skip
the <i>Falcon!</i>

144
00:14:44,052 --> 00:14:45,383
Actually,
it turns out you can.

145
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,086
All right, guys,
we just landed, okay?

146
00:14:47,088 --> 00:14:48,319
What happened?

147
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:49,220
Bad news,
that's what happened.

148
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,255
No spy?

149
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:51,456
No. Spy.

150
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,858
Did we make contact
with a spy or not?

151
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,126
There's a mole
in the First Order,

152
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:55,260
and they sent us a message.

153
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:56,494
You dropped a tree on him?

154
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:57,595
You blew
both sub-alternators?

155
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:58,864
Well,
you know what...

156
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:00,298
maybe you should've been
out there with us!

157
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,232
You know I wanna be
out there with you.

158
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,467
Yeah, but you're not.

159
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:04,136
You're here training.
For what?

160
00:15:04,138 --> 00:15:05,739
You're the best fighter
we have.

161
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:07,572
We need you.

162
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,340
Out there, not here.

163
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:10,775
Junior...

164
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,044
get Artoo
into reconditioning.

165
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:13,246
It's true.

166
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,649
What's the message?

167
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:20,385
We've decoded the intel
from the First Order spy...

168
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:22,322
and it confirms the worst.

169
00:15:23,724 --> 00:15:26,224
Somehow,
Palpatine returned.

170
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:32,998
Wait.
Do we believe this?

171
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,432
It cannot be.

172
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,567
The Emperor is dead.

173
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:38,536
Dark science.
Cloning.

174
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:39,939
Secrets only the Sith knew.

175
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:41,974
He's been planning
his revenge.

176
00:15:41,976 --> 00:15:45,710
His followers have been
building something for years.

177
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:48,415
The largest fleet
the galaxy has ever known.

178
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,984
He calls it
the Final Order.

179
00:15:51,986 --> 00:15:55,821
In 16 hours, attacks
on all free worlds begin.

180
00:15:56,891 --> 00:15:58,356
The Emperor and his fleet
have been hiding

181
00:15:58,358 --> 00:15:59,693
in the Unknown Regions.

182
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:01,929
On a world called Exegol.

183
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,700
Exegol does not appear
on any star chart.

184
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:13,304
But legend describes it as
the hidden world of the Sith.

185
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,807
There were always whispers

186
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:17,475
of his hunger to cheat death.

187
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,879
So, Palpatine's been
out there all this time.

188
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:21,412
Pulling the strings.

189
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:24,083
Always. In the shadows.
From the very beginning.

190
00:16:24,085 --> 00:16:27,621
If we want to stop him,
we must find him.

191
00:16:28,923 --> 00:16:30,355
Must find Exegol.

192
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:31,758
General?

193
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,227
Can I speak with you?

194
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:36,829
I know how to get
to Exegol.

195
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:38,998
- Tell me.
- Luke searched for it.

196
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,566
For a long time.
He nearly found it.

197
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,903
There are ciphers here
I can't read.

198
00:16:43,905 --> 00:16:46,638
But he said to get there,
you need one of these.

199
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,606
A Sith wayfinder.

200
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:51,609
They're compasses
that lead the way to Exegol.

201
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,345
To stop what we both know
is coming...

202
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,449
I need to finish
what Luke started.

203
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:58,884
Find Exegol.

204
00:16:58,886 --> 00:17:00,119
Find the Emperor.

205
00:17:00,121 --> 00:17:02,620
No.

206
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,959
I don't want to go without
your blessing, but I will.

207
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:08,762
I will.

208
00:17:10,064 --> 00:17:11,731
It's what you would do.

209
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,532
So, you got her
up and running?

210
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,101
You were right before.

211
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:18,403
I'm gonna pick up
Luke's search for Exegol.

212
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:20,605
I'm gonna start
where his trail went cold.

213
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:22,540
The Forbidden Desert
of Pasaana.

214
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,877
Yeah, I know.
We're going with you.

215
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:26,846
Chewie, you get
that compressor fixed?

216
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:28,780
I need to go alone.

217
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:30,115
Yeah. Alone with friends.

218
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:31,451
It's too dangerous, Finn.

219
00:17:32,153 --> 00:17:33,252
We go together.

220
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:39,126
I wholeheartedly agree.

221
00:17:45,032 --> 00:17:46,497
Rose, last chance.

222
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,466
The General asked me to study
the specs of old Destroyers.

223
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:49,869
So we can stop the fleet
if you find it.

224
00:17:49,871 --> 00:17:50,735
"If"?

225
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,807
When.

226
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:54,942
When.

227
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:05,385
Hey, we should get going.

228
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:08,755
What is it?

229
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:11,389
Nothing.

230
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:14,159
In the event
that I do not return...

231
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:15,526
I want you to know

232
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,899
that you have been
a real friend, Artoo.

233
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,567
My best one, in fact.

234
00:18:25,373 --> 00:18:28,408
There's so much
I want to tell you.

235
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,946
Tell me when you get back.

236
00:18:53,234 --> 00:18:54,967
Rey...

237
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:58,039
never be afraid
of who you are.

238
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:20,760
It is.

239
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,409
<i>Knights of Ren.</i>

240
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:11,611
<i>Ghouls.</i>

241
00:20:15,316 --> 00:20:17,816
<i>We have a spy
in our ranks...</i>

242
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:20,919
<i>who just sent a message
to the Resistance.</i>

243
00:20:20,921 --> 00:20:24,091
<i>Whoever this traitor is
won't stop us.</i>

244
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:27,860
<i>With what I've seen
on Exegol...</i>

245
00:20:27,862 --> 00:20:30,931
<i>the First Order is about to
become a true Empire.</i>

246
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:38,738
<i>I sense unease about
my appearance, General Hux.</i>

247
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:43,608
About the mask?

248
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,111
No, sir. Well done.

249
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:47,279
I like it.

250
00:20:47,281 --> 00:20:51,582
Forgive me, sir,
but these allies on Exegol...

251
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:52,784
they sound like a cult.

252
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:54,820
Conjurers
and soothsayers.

253
00:20:54,822 --> 00:20:57,089
They've conjured
legions of Star Destroyers.

254
00:20:57,091 --> 00:20:59,425
The Sith fleet
will increase our resources

255
00:20:59,427 --> 00:21:01,126
ten-thousandfold.

256
00:21:01,128 --> 00:21:03,462
Such range and power
will correct the error

257
00:21:03,464 --> 00:21:05,097
of Starkiller Base.

258
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:06,899
We'll need
to increase recruitments.

259
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:08,901
Harvest more of
the galaxy's young.

260
00:21:08,903 --> 00:21:11,136
This fleet,
what is it, a gift?

261
00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:13,573
What is he asking for
in return?

262
00:21:16,177 --> 00:21:19,812
<i>Prepare to crush
any worlds that defy us.</i>

263
00:21:19,814 --> 00:21:21,547
<i>My knights and I
are going hunting</i>

264
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:23,184
<i>for the scavenger.</i>

265
00:21:32,827 --> 00:21:34,159
You sure
this is it?

266
00:21:34,161 --> 00:21:35,961
These are
the exact coordinates

267
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:37,331
that Master Luke
left behind.

268
00:21:43,938 --> 00:21:45,537
What is this?

269
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:48,373
The Acky Acky
Festival of the Ancestors.

270
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:52,244
This celebration occurs
only once every 42 years.

271
00:21:52,246 --> 00:21:53,112
Well, that's lucky.

272
00:21:53,114 --> 00:21:54,880
Lucky indeed.

273
00:21:54,882 --> 00:21:57,483
This festival is known
for both its colorful kites...

274
00:21:57,485 --> 00:21:59,752
and its delectable sweets.

275
00:22:20,975 --> 00:22:23,142
I've never seen
anything like this.

276
00:22:23,144 --> 00:22:25,010
I've never seen
so few wayfinders.

277
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:26,979
There's always random
First Order patrols

278
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:28,547
in crowds like these.

279
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:29,982
So, keep your heads
down.

280
00:22:29,984 --> 00:22:31,116
Chewie.

281
00:22:36,357 --> 00:22:39,057
Let's split up.
See what the locals know.

282
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,746
She is saying,
"Welcome."

283
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:12,925
Her name is Nambi Ghima.

284
00:23:12,927 --> 00:23:15,726
That's an excellent name.
I'm Rey.

285
00:23:17,398 --> 00:23:20,301
She would be honored
to know your family name, too.

286
00:23:23,404 --> 00:23:24,903
I don't have one.

287
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:26,307
I'm just Rey.

288
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:48,362
<i>Palpatine wants you dead.</i>

289
00:23:49,663 --> 00:23:52,333
- Serving another master?
- <i>No.</i>

290
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:55,467
<i>I have other plans.</i>

291
00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:58,403
<i>I offered you
my hand once.</i>

292
00:23:58,405 --> 00:24:00,107
<i>You wanted to take it.</i>

293
00:24:01,442 --> 00:24:02,443
<i>Why didn't you?</i>

294
00:24:03,644 --> 00:24:05,577
You could've killed me.

295
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:07,081
Why didn't you?

296
00:24:08,315 --> 00:24:10,415
<i>You can't hide, Rey.</i>

297
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:11,485
<i>Not from me.</i>

298
00:24:12,886 --> 00:24:15,721
I see through the cracks
in your mask.

299
00:24:15,723 --> 00:24:17,256
You're haunted.

300
00:24:17,258 --> 00:24:21,426
You can't stop seeing
what you did to your father.

301
00:24:21,428 --> 00:24:22,828
<i>Do you still
count the days</i>

302
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,365
<i>since your parents left?</i>

303
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:29,468
<i>Such pain in you,
such anger.</i>

304
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,405
<i>I don't wanna
have to kill you.</i>

305
00:24:32,606 --> 00:24:33,905
<i>I'm going to find you</i>

306
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:35,843
<i>and I'm going to turn you
to the dark side.</i>

307
00:24:37,211 --> 00:24:39,446
<i>When I offer you
my hand again...</i>

308
00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:41,415
<i>you'll take it.</i>

309
00:24:43,384 --> 00:24:44,385
We'll see.

310
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:51,890
Has he seen him?

311
00:24:51,892 --> 00:24:54,026
We have to go.
Back to the <i>Falcon.</i> Now.

312
00:24:54,028 --> 00:24:55,896
- Why?
- It's Ren.

313
00:24:57,965 --> 00:24:59,598
Sir,
we've had this analyzed.

314
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,233
It comes
from the Middian System,

315
00:25:01,235 --> 00:25:02,668
Pasaana, Forbidden Valley.

316
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,036
<i>Prepare my ship.</i>

317
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:06,138
<i>Alert the local troops.
Send a division.</i>

318
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,509
Yes, Supreme Leader.

319
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:12,678
<i>Freeze.</i>

320
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,879
<i>Hold it right there.</i>

321
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:15,647
<i>I've located
the Resistance fugitives.</i>

322
00:25:15,649 --> 00:25:16,748
<i>All units, report...</i>

323
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:23,857
<i>Follow me.</i>

324
00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:33,334
<i>Hurry.</i>

325
00:25:35,002 --> 00:25:37,436
<i>Leia sent me
a transmission.</i>

326
00:25:37,438 --> 00:25:40,105
Okay.

327
00:25:40,107 --> 00:25:41,942
How'd you find us?

328
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:45,644
Wookiees
stand out in a crowd.

329
00:25:49,516 --> 00:25:51,950
It's good to see you too,
old buddy.

330
00:25:51,952 --> 00:25:54,052
This is
General Lando Calrissian.

331
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:55,120
We know who he is,
Threepio.

332
00:25:55,122 --> 00:25:57,322
It is an honor, General.

333
00:25:57,324 --> 00:26:00,027
General Calrissian,
we're looking for Exegol.

334
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:04,131
Of course you are.

335
00:26:06,734 --> 00:26:08,133
Only two were made.

336
00:26:08,135 --> 00:26:10,268
A Sith wayfinder.

337
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,170
Luke Skywalker came here
to find one.

338
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:15,073
I know.
I was with him.

339
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:17,411
Luke and I were tailing
an old Jedi hunter.

340
00:26:18,612 --> 00:26:20,212
Ochi of Bestoon.

341
00:26:20,214 --> 00:26:21,446
He was carrying a clue

342
00:26:21,448 --> 00:26:24,049
that could lead
to a wayfinder.

343
00:26:24,051 --> 00:26:27,018
We followed his ship halfway
across the galaxy here.

344
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,254
When we got to his ship,
it was abandoned...

345
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:32,257
No clue. No wayfinder.

346
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:33,525
Is Ochi's ship still here?

347
00:26:33,527 --> 00:26:35,427
It's out in the desert,
where he left it.

348
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:37,729
We need to get to that ship.
Search it again.

349
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:48,673
I got a bad feeling
about this.

350
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:51,209
Ochi's ship
is out past Lurch Canyon.

351
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:53,478
- Go.
- Thank you, General.

352
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,614
You too, Chewie.

353
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,349
Leia needs pilots, General.

354
00:26:57,351 --> 00:27:00,485
My flying days are long gone.

355
00:27:00,487 --> 00:27:02,089
But do me a favor...

356
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:05,223
give Leia my love.

357
00:27:05,225 --> 00:27:07,759
You should
give it to her yourself.

358
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:09,029
Thank you.

359
00:27:16,937 --> 00:27:18,539
There!
Those speeders.

360
00:27:28,883 --> 00:27:30,449
How do you know
how to do that?

361
00:27:30,451 --> 00:27:32,184
No need to worry.
I made it.

362
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:36,256
We gotta go.

363
00:27:42,229 --> 00:27:43,630
<i>We've spotted the fugitives.</i>

364
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:05,650
Oh! They fly now!

365
00:28:05,652 --> 00:28:07,087
They fly now?

366
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:08,689
They fly now.

367
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:34,279
Did we lose them?

368
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:36,016
- Looks like it!
- Excellent job, sir!

369
00:28:39,186 --> 00:28:40,554
Terrible job, sir!

370
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:47,160
Not now, BB-8.

371
00:28:59,908 --> 00:29:02,209
Never underestimate a droid.

372
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,230
Poe!

373
00:29:27,568 --> 00:29:29,100
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

374
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:30,470
Right, ho!

375
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:45,686
Ochi's ship.

376
00:29:46,988 --> 00:29:48,687
I've seen that ship before.

377
00:29:48,689 --> 00:29:49,822
Rey!

378
00:29:49,824 --> 00:29:51,124
You get all
of them?

379
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,880
What the hell is this?

380
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,683
Sinking fields!
Try to grab something!

381
00:30:18,685 --> 00:30:21,786
Will this agony ever end?

382
00:30:21,788 --> 00:30:22,822
Come on!

383
00:30:22,824 --> 00:30:24,857
BB-8! No!

384
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:25,925
Rey.

385
00:30:25,927 --> 00:30:27,325
Rey, I never told you...

386
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:29,229
What? Finn!

387
00:30:41,976 --> 00:30:43,174
General.

388
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:44,242
We're getting reports
of a raid

389
00:30:44,244 --> 00:30:45,677
at the Festival
of Ancestors.

390
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,279
This mission is everything.
We cannot fail.

391
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:50,116
Any word from Rey?

392
00:30:50,118 --> 00:30:52,084
<i>Falcon's</i> not responding.

393
00:30:52,086 --> 00:30:53,585
Do you have to say it
like that?

394
00:30:53,587 --> 00:30:54,719
Like what?

395
00:30:54,721 --> 00:30:57,255
Do me a personal favor?
Be optimistic.

396
00:30:57,257 --> 00:30:58,490
Yes, ma'am.

397
00:30:58,492 --> 00:31:00,525
Uh, this is...
This is terrific.

398
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:02,327
You're not gonna believe how
well this is gonna turn out.

399
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:04,663
It's gonna be great.

400
00:31:12,205 --> 00:31:13,939
Rey! Finn!

401
00:31:13,941 --> 00:31:16,142
You didn't say my
name, sir, but I'm all right.

402
00:31:22,249 --> 00:31:23,682
- You all right?
- Yeah.

403
00:31:23,684 --> 00:31:24,749
Where's Finn?

404
00:31:24,751 --> 00:31:25,818
Where's Chewie?

405
00:31:27,822 --> 00:31:28,687
I'm good.

406
00:31:28,689 --> 00:31:30,221
Ah.
Master Finn.

407
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:31,589
What is this place?

408
00:31:31,591 --> 00:31:33,092
This isn't
the afterlife, is it?

409
00:31:33,094 --> 00:31:34,225
Are droids allowed here?

410
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:35,293
I thought
we were goners.

411
00:31:35,295 --> 00:31:36,728
We might still be.

412
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,265
Which way out?

413
00:31:44,271 --> 00:31:46,304
We have to hurry.

414
00:31:46,306 --> 00:31:47,907
- So, what was it?
- What?

415
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:49,942
- What you were gonna tell me?
- When?

416
00:31:49,944 --> 00:31:51,509
When you were sinking
in the sand, you said...

417
00:31:51,511 --> 00:31:53,213
"I never told you..."

418
00:31:54,148 --> 00:31:55,280
I'll tell you later.

419
00:31:55,282 --> 00:31:57,215
You mean
when Poe's not here?

420
00:31:57,217 --> 00:31:58,450
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

421
00:31:58,452 --> 00:31:59,517
We're gonna die
in sand burrows

422
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,685
and we're all
keeping secrets?

423
00:32:00,687 --> 00:32:01,987
I'll tell you
when you tell us

424
00:32:01,989 --> 00:32:03,288
about all that shifty stuff
you do.

425
00:32:04,658 --> 00:32:06,558
I do not wanna know
what made these tunnels.

426
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,960
Judging by
the circumference

427
00:32:07,962 --> 00:32:09,128
of the tunnel walls...

428
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,762
I said
I do not wanna know.

429
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:12,064
Not.

430
00:32:12,066 --> 00:32:13,264
What's that?

431
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:14,432
- Is that a speeder?
- What?

432
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:15,767
An old one.

433
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:17,669
Perhaps we will
find the driver.

434
00:32:17,671 --> 00:32:20,172
Yep, BB-8, I think dead, too.

435
00:32:20,174 --> 00:32:22,707
Oh, my.
A hex charm.

436
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:23,775
A what?

437
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:26,112
A common emblem
of Sith loyalists.

438
00:32:26,114 --> 00:32:27,278
Sith.

439
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,580
This was Ochi's?

440
00:32:28,582 --> 00:32:31,951
Luke sensed it.
Ochi never left this place.

441
00:32:31,953 --> 00:32:33,384
And he ended up
down here.

442
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:34,786
He was headed
for his ship.

443
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:36,421
Same thing happened to us,
happened to him.

444
00:32:36,423 --> 00:32:37,923
So, how did
Ochi get out?

445
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:38,926
He didn't.

446
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:44,629
No, he didn't.

447
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:46,031
Bones.

448
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:47,465
I don't like bones.

449
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:49,837
Bones?
Never a good sign.

450
00:32:51,906 --> 00:32:53,306
Yeah, I see it.

451
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:08,120
Horrible things...

452
00:33:08,122 --> 00:33:09,354
have happened with this.

453
00:33:09,356 --> 00:33:11,123
There's writing on it.

454
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:13,491
Perhaps I can translate.

455
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:16,461
Oh. The location
of the wayfinder,

456
00:33:16,463 --> 00:33:18,696
has been inscribed
upon this dagger.

457
00:33:18,698 --> 00:33:21,533
It's the clue that Master
Luke was looking for.

458
00:33:21,535 --> 00:33:23,568
- And?
- Where's the wayfinder?

459
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:26,504
I am afraid
I cannot tell you.

460
00:33:26,506 --> 00:33:28,573
20.3 fazillion languages,
you can't read that?

461
00:33:28,575 --> 00:33:30,209
Oh, I have read it, sir.

462
00:33:30,211 --> 00:33:33,378
I know exactly
where the wayfinder is.

463
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,613
Unfortunately,
it is written

464
00:33:35,615 --> 00:33:37,482
in the runic language
of the Sith.

465
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:38,851
So what?

466
00:33:38,853 --> 00:33:41,020
My programming forbids
me from translating it.

467
00:33:41,022 --> 00:33:42,487
So, you're telling us
the one time

468
00:33:42,489 --> 00:33:44,123
we need you to talk,
you can't?

469
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:45,858
Irony, sir.

470
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,592
I am mechanically
incapable

471
00:33:47,594 --> 00:33:49,394
of speaking translations
from Sith.

472
00:33:49,396 --> 00:33:50,762
I believe the rule
was passed

473
00:33:50,764 --> 00:33:53,165
by the Senate of
the Old Republic...

474
00:33:54,734 --> 00:33:57,704
Serpent! Serpent! Serpent!

475
00:34:10,151 --> 00:34:12,686
Rey.

476
00:34:20,694 --> 00:34:21,896
- Finn.
- Shh.

477
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:40,212
- I'm gonna blast it.
- Don't blast it.

478
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:39,972
I just transferred
a bit of life.

479
00:35:39,974 --> 00:35:41,874
Force energy
from me to him.

480
00:35:41,876 --> 00:35:44,544
You would've done the same.

481
00:36:06,133 --> 00:36:08,700
We cannot possibly fly
in that old wreck.

482
00:36:08,702 --> 00:36:10,235
We gotta keep moving.

483
00:36:10,237 --> 00:36:11,837
Find someone who can
translate that dagger.

484
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,538
Like a helpful droid.

485
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,175
I suggest we return to
the <i>Millennium Falcon</i> at once.

486
00:36:16,177 --> 00:36:18,010
They'll be waiting for us
at the <i>Falcon.</i>

487
00:36:18,012 --> 00:36:19,510
Yeah,
they'll throw us in the Pits of Griq.

488
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:22,047
Yeah. And use you
as a target droid.

489
00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:25,119
You both make
excellent points, at times.

490
00:36:29,156 --> 00:36:30,224
What is it?

491
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:32,860
I'll be right behind you.

492
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,761
It's okay.

493
00:36:44,504 --> 00:36:45,940
Let's see what we got.

494
00:36:47,707 --> 00:36:49,844
Let's get
those converters fired up.

495
00:36:55,383 --> 00:36:58,984
What a filthy ship!

496
00:36:58,986 --> 00:37:00,888
Look at that.

497
00:37:02,123 --> 00:37:03,124
Where is she?

498
00:37:07,928 --> 00:37:09,962
Finn,
help me out over here.

499
00:37:09,964 --> 00:37:12,665
Chewie, tell Rey we gotta go.

500
00:38:00,948 --> 00:38:02,548
What's she doing?

501
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,951
Where the hell's Chewie?

502
00:38:06,987 --> 00:38:07,988
It's Ren.

503
00:38:23,204 --> 00:38:24,872
<i>All right, let's go.</i>

504
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:26,839
<i>Get in the transport.</i>

505
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:28,042
<i>Move, animal!</i>

506
00:39:43,683 --> 00:39:44,885
Rey!

507
00:39:45,386 --> 00:39:46,451
Rey!

508
00:39:47,988 --> 00:39:50,824
They got Chewie!
They got him!

509
00:40:58,592 --> 00:40:59,691
Chewie!

510
00:40:59,693 --> 00:41:00,928
No!

511
00:41:05,798 --> 00:41:07,334
Rey!

512
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:12,137
We gotta go!
They're coming!

513
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:13,705
Rey, come on!

514
00:41:16,744 --> 00:41:19,111
Rey!

515
00:41:19,113 --> 00:41:21,680
- We gotta go!
- Chewie.

516
00:41:21,682 --> 00:41:23,783
Rey, come on!

517
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:46,473
I lost control.

518
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:49,241
It wasn't your fault.

519
00:41:49,243 --> 00:41:50,275
It was.

520
00:41:50,277 --> 00:41:52,577
No. It was Ren.
He made you do it.

521
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:54,081
Chewie's gone.

522
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:57,382
That power came from me.

523
00:41:57,384 --> 00:41:59,520
Finn, there are things
you don't know.

524
00:42:00,721 --> 00:42:02,589
Then tell me.

525
00:42:08,562 --> 00:42:11,298
I, uh, had a vision.

526
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:15,903
Of the throne of the Sith.

527
00:42:17,404 --> 00:42:18,906
And who was on it.

528
00:42:19,573 --> 00:42:20,574
Ren?

529
00:42:22,076 --> 00:42:24,478
And me.

530
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:41,126
We recovered
the scavenger's ship,

531
00:42:41,128 --> 00:42:42,627
but she got away.

532
00:42:42,629 --> 00:42:44,496
Under command
of the Knights of Ren,

533
00:42:44,498 --> 00:42:45,897
we suffered losses.

534
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:48,600
- A transport was destroyed.
- I've seen the report.

535
00:42:48,602 --> 00:42:50,235
That all?

536
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:51,970
No, Allegiant General.

537
00:42:51,972 --> 00:42:53,874
There was another transport
in the desert.

538
00:42:55,209 --> 00:42:57,411
It brought back
a valuable prisoner.

539
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,581
Prisoner?

540
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:08,387
The beast used to fly
with Han Solo.

541
00:43:10,357 --> 00:43:12,424
Take it to Interrogation Six.

542
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:14,626
<i>Move it.</i>

543
00:43:14,628 --> 00:43:16,228
We've only got
eight hours left.

544
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,629
So, what are we gonna do?

545
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,264
What can we do?
We gotta go back to base.

546
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:21,233
We don't have time to go back.
We are not giving up.

547
00:43:21,235 --> 00:43:22,968
If we do that,
Chewie died for nothing.

548
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,302
Poe, Chewie
had the dagger!

549
00:43:24,304 --> 00:43:25,670
Well, then we gotta
find another way.

550
00:43:25,672 --> 00:43:27,205
Well, there isn't.
That was the only clue

551
00:43:27,207 --> 00:43:28,607
to the wayfinder thing,
and it's gone.

552
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:29,908
So true.

553
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:32,179
The inscription lives
only in my memory now.

554
00:43:34,248 --> 00:43:35,848
Hold on.

555
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:38,885
The inscription that was on
the dagger is in your memory?

556
00:43:38,887 --> 00:43:40,352
Yes, Master Poe.

557
00:43:40,354 --> 00:43:42,287
But the translation
from a forbidden language

558
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:43,722
cannot be retrieved.

559
00:43:43,724 --> 00:43:46,859
That is short of a complete
redacted memory bypass.

560
00:43:46,861 --> 00:43:48,160
A complete what?

561
00:43:48,162 --> 00:43:49,628
It's a terribly
dangerous and sinful act...

562
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:52,631
performed on unwitting droids
by dregs and criminals.

563
00:43:52,633 --> 00:43:53,932
Let's do that.

564
00:43:53,934 --> 00:43:55,700
I know
a black market droidsmith.

565
00:43:55,702 --> 00:43:57,102
Black market droidsmith?

566
00:43:57,104 --> 00:43:58,970
- But he's on Kijimi.
- What's wrong with Kijimi?

567
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:00,574
I had a little bad luck
on Kijimi.

568
00:44:02,209 --> 00:44:05,277
But if this mission fails,
it's all been for nothing.

569
00:44:05,279 --> 00:44:08,081
All we've done,
all this time.

570
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:12,019
We're all in this.

571
00:44:13,086 --> 00:44:14,588
Until the end.

572
00:44:18,927 --> 00:44:20,127
For Chewie.

573
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:23,464
- Hands?
- Hands.

574
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:26,033
For Chewie.

575
00:44:30,805 --> 00:44:32,005
Kijimi.

576
00:45:05,807 --> 00:45:07,541
Battery charged.

577
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:09,876
Hello.

578
00:45:14,916 --> 00:45:16,414
Hello.

579
00:45:16,416 --> 00:45:18,252
- Hello.
- No... No, thank you.

580
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:23,388
Looks like someone
treated him badly.

581
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:26,291
It's all right.
You're with us now.

582
00:45:34,268 --> 00:45:36,268
<i>U-A-T-T walker patrol,</i>

583
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,870
<i>head down thoroughfare 60.</i>

584
00:45:52,987 --> 00:45:55,120
<i>Open up.
You're wanted for questioning.</i>

585
00:45:59,793 --> 00:46:02,060
<i>Check this side of the street.</i>

586
00:46:05,732 --> 00:46:06,999
<i>Door is locked.</i>

587
00:46:07,001 --> 00:46:08,567
<i>Move on to the next one.</i>

588
00:46:08,569 --> 00:46:10,435
<i>Give me
regular reports, please.</i>

589
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:12,972
<i>You, up against the wall.</i>

590
00:46:12,974 --> 00:46:15,240
<i>Show me your identification.</i>

591
00:46:15,242 --> 00:46:16,643
<i>Where is your identification?</i>

592
00:46:17,812 --> 00:46:19,578
They're everywhere.

593
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,413
Please, leave her alone.
She didn't do anything.

594
00:46:21,415 --> 00:46:22,949
All right,
I know what we should do.

595
00:46:22,951 --> 00:46:24,616
So do I.
We should leave.

596
00:46:24,618 --> 00:46:26,284
Clam it, Threepio.

597
00:46:26,286 --> 00:46:27,487
Follow me.

598
00:46:34,728 --> 00:46:37,197
All right.
Let's head down this way.

599
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:40,765
<i>Heard you were
spotted at Monk's Gate.</i>

600
00:46:40,767 --> 00:46:43,836
<i>Thought, "He's not stupid
enough to come back here."</i>

601
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:45,337
Oh, you'd be surprised.

602
00:46:45,339 --> 00:46:46,839
- Who's this?
- What's going on?

603
00:46:46,841 --> 00:46:48,975
Guys, this is Zorii.
Zorii, this is Rey and Finn.

604
00:46:48,977 --> 00:46:50,775
<i>I could pull this
trigger right now.</i>

605
00:46:50,777 --> 00:46:52,410
- I've seen you do worse.
- <i>For a lot less.</i>

606
00:46:52,412 --> 00:46:55,480
Can we just, uh...
talk about this?

607
00:46:55,482 --> 00:46:57,817
<i>I wanna see your
brains in the snow.</i>

608
00:46:57,819 --> 00:46:59,117
So, you're still mad?

609
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,518
Zorii, we could
use your help.

610
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,320
We gotta crack this droid's
head open and fast.

611
00:47:02,322 --> 00:47:03,521
Pardon me!

612
00:47:03,523 --> 00:47:04,924
We're trying to find
Babu Frik.

613
00:47:04,926 --> 00:47:06,025
<i>Babu?
Babu only works with the crew.</i>

614
00:47:06,027 --> 00:47:07,325
<i>That's not you anymore.</i>

615
00:47:07,327 --> 00:47:08,593
What crew?

616
00:47:08,595 --> 00:47:10,062
<i>Oh, funny
he never mentioned it.</i>

617
00:47:10,064 --> 00:47:12,832
<i>Your friend's old job
was running spice.</i>

618
00:47:12,834 --> 00:47:14,265
You were a spice runner?

619
00:47:14,267 --> 00:47:15,935
- You were a stormtrooper?
- Were you a spice runner?

620
00:47:15,937 --> 00:47:17,535
Were you a scavenger?
We could do this all night.

621
00:47:17,537 --> 00:47:19,071
<i>You don't have
all night.</i>

622
00:47:19,073 --> 00:47:21,439
<i>You know, I'm still digging
out of the hole you put me in</i>

623
00:47:21,441 --> 00:47:23,410
<i>when you left
to join the Resistance.</i>

624
00:47:24,112 --> 00:47:25,510
<i>You.</i>

625
00:47:25,512 --> 00:47:27,212
<i>You're the one
they're looking for.</i>

626
00:47:27,214 --> 00:47:29,347
<i>Bounty for her
just might cover us.</i>

627
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:31,316
- <i>Djak'kankah!</i>
- Don't <i>djak'kankah.</i>

628
00:47:38,425 --> 00:47:40,558
We could really use
your help.

629
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,762
Please.

630
00:47:42,997 --> 00:47:46,398
<i>Not that you care...</i>

631
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,168
<i>but I think you're okay.</i>

632
00:47:48,702 --> 00:47:49,904
I care.

633
00:47:53,908 --> 00:47:55,707
<i>T-18's online yet?</i>

634
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:57,277
<i>Yes, sir.
Scouting the perimeter.</i>

635
00:47:58,612 --> 00:48:00,815
<i>Walkers.
Stay close by.</i>

636
00:48:02,917 --> 00:48:05,951
Poe Dameron, spice runner.
Runner of spice.

637
00:48:05,953 --> 00:48:07,719
- All right.
- Get your spice!

638
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:09,556
- Come on, Threepio.
- Oh.

639
00:48:24,404 --> 00:48:25,805
<i>Babu's in the back.</i>

640
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:37,617
Don't mind us.

641
00:48:41,856 --> 00:48:45,223
I haven't the faintest idea
why I agreed to this.

642
00:48:45,225 --> 00:48:47,126
I must be malfunctioning.

643
00:48:47,128 --> 00:48:48,795
I must be malfunctioning.

644
00:48:49,864 --> 00:48:51,197
Babu Frik?

645
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,932
Can you help us with this?

646
00:48:58,271 --> 00:49:00,638
Zorii?
Is this gonna work?

647
00:49:06,747 --> 00:49:08,147
<i>He says
he's found something</i>

648
00:49:08,149 --> 00:49:09,447
<i>in your droid's
forbidden memory bank.</i>

649
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:11,150
<i>Words, translated
from Sith.</i>

650
00:49:11,152 --> 00:49:13,351
- That's it.
- Yeah, that's what we need.

651
00:49:13,353 --> 00:49:16,188
<i>Who are you hanging out
with that speaks Sith?</i>

652
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:17,756
Can you make him...

653
00:49:17,758 --> 00:49:19,959
Babu, can you make him
translate it?

654
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:25,263
<i>Yes. But it will
cause a complete...</i>

655
00:49:25,265 --> 00:49:26,866
A complete
memory wipe.

656
00:49:26,868 --> 00:49:28,733
Wait, wait, wait.
We make him translate it...

657
00:49:28,735 --> 00:49:31,269
he won't remember...
anything?

658
00:49:31,271 --> 00:49:33,304
Droid, memory go blank.

659
00:49:33,306 --> 00:49:34,506
- Oh!
- Blank, blank.

660
00:49:34,508 --> 00:49:35,774
There must be
some other way.

661
00:49:35,776 --> 00:49:37,209
Doesn't Artoo back up
your memory?

662
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:38,543
Oh, please.

663
00:49:38,545 --> 00:49:41,579
Artoo's storage units
are famously unreliable.

664
00:49:41,581 --> 00:49:43,717
You know the odds
better than any of us.

665
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:47,054
Do we have a choice?

666
00:49:53,194 --> 00:49:56,095
If this mission fails...

667
00:49:56,097 --> 00:49:57,832
it was all for nothing.

668
00:49:59,066 --> 00:50:00,734
All we've done...

669
00:50:01,434 --> 00:50:03,303
all this time.

670
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:09,543
What are you doing there,
Threepio?

671
00:50:10,443 --> 00:50:13,313
Taking one last look,
sir...

672
00:50:13,948 --> 00:50:15,817
at my friends.

673
00:50:18,853 --> 00:50:19,854
Sad.

674
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:24,089
Uh-oh.

675
00:50:24,091 --> 00:50:25,891
<i>Night raids
are gonna start soon.</i>

676
00:50:25,893 --> 00:50:27,659
- <i>I'll keep lookout.</i>
- I'm coming with you.

677
00:50:27,661 --> 00:50:30,262
<i>You still
don't trust me, huh?</i>

678
00:50:30,264 --> 00:50:31,429
Did you
ever trust me?

679
00:50:31,431 --> 00:50:32,730
<i>Nope.</i>

680
00:50:37,939 --> 00:50:39,537
<i>Report,
General Pryde.</i>

681
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:40,873
There's been
a development, sir.

682
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:43,142
The Knights of Ren
have tracked the scavenger.

683
00:50:43,144 --> 00:50:44,776
To a settlement
called Kijimi.

684
00:50:44,778 --> 00:50:47,112
Shall we destroy
the city,

685
00:50:47,114 --> 00:50:48,448
Supreme...?

686
00:50:54,421 --> 00:50:55,720
I just had an idea.

687
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:57,488
There's something else
we could try.

688
00:51:11,705 --> 00:51:13,738
How long's it been
like this?

689
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,909
<i>First Order took most
of the kids a long time ago.</i>

690
00:51:16,911 --> 00:51:19,311
<i>Can't stand the cries
anymore.</i>

691
00:51:19,313 --> 00:51:21,379
<i>I've saved up enough
to get out.</i>

692
00:51:21,381 --> 00:51:22,714
<i>I'm going to the Colonies.</i>

693
00:51:22,716 --> 00:51:24,718
How? All those hyperlanes
are blocked.

694
00:51:28,655 --> 00:51:32,291
That's a First Order
Captain's medallion.

695
00:51:32,293 --> 00:51:33,893
I've never seen a real one.

696
00:51:33,895 --> 00:51:35,793
<i>Free passage
through any blockade.</i>

697
00:51:35,795 --> 00:51:37,832
<i>Landing privileges,
any vessel.</i>

698
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,975
<i>Wanna come with me?</i>

699
00:51:54,514 --> 00:51:56,783
I can't walk out
on this war.

700
00:51:58,518 --> 00:52:00,585
Not till it's over.

701
00:52:00,587 --> 00:52:02,023
Maybe it is.

702
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:06,994
We sent out a call for help
at the Battle of Crait.

703
00:52:08,595 --> 00:52:10,695
Nobody came.

704
00:52:10,697 --> 00:52:12,532
Everyone's so afraid.

705
00:52:15,102 --> 00:52:16,569
They've given up.

706
00:52:17,805 --> 00:52:20,540
<i>No, I don't believe
you believe that.</i>

707
00:52:23,311 --> 00:52:25,177
<i>Hey.</i>

708
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:28,581
<i>They win by making you
think you're alone.</i>

709
00:52:29,616 --> 00:52:31,551
<i>Remember?</i>

710
00:52:34,255 --> 00:52:36,123
<i>There's more of us.</i>

711
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:42,194
Squeaky wheel.

712
00:52:42,196 --> 00:52:43,898
I have a squeaky wheel.

713
00:52:48,436 --> 00:52:51,036
Squeak eliminated.

714
00:52:51,038 --> 00:52:52,838
Thank you.

715
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,075
Very kind.

716
00:53:00,948 --> 00:53:03,282
Something's not right
about all of this.

717
00:53:03,284 --> 00:53:04,582
Hmm?

718
00:53:04,584 --> 00:53:05,884
I know
where I've seen it.

719
00:53:05,886 --> 00:53:08,387
The ship he was on.
Ochi's ship.

720
00:53:08,389 --> 00:53:09,822
What?

721
00:53:09,824 --> 00:53:11,658
The day my parents left.

722
00:53:12,492 --> 00:53:14,061
They were on that ship.

723
00:53:15,096 --> 00:53:17,262
Are you sure?

724
00:53:17,264 --> 00:53:18,831
<i>There's an
incoming Destroyer.</i>

725
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:21,333
We gotta go now.
Did we get it? Babu?

726
00:53:21,335 --> 00:53:24,436
Yep. Droid is ready!

727
00:53:28,608 --> 00:53:30,242
The Emperor's wayfinder

728
00:53:30,244 --> 00:53:31,810
is in the Imperial vault.

729
00:53:31,812 --> 00:53:36,048
At delta 3-6, transient
9-3-6, bearing 3-2...

730
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:38,484
on a moon
in the Endor system.

731
00:53:38,486 --> 00:53:39,918
From the southern shore.

732
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,788
Only this blade tells.

733
00:53:42,622 --> 00:53:44,291
Only this blade tells.

734
00:53:48,661 --> 00:53:50,329
The Endor system.

735
00:53:50,331 --> 00:53:51,497
Where the last war ended?

736
00:53:58,906 --> 00:53:59,974
Rey!

737
00:54:03,444 --> 00:54:04,642
Ren's Destroyer.

738
00:54:04,644 --> 00:54:05,913
He's here?

739
00:54:10,217 --> 00:54:11,551
Chewie?

740
00:54:12,786 --> 00:54:14,386
What about him?

741
00:54:14,388 --> 00:54:16,321
He's on Ren's ship.

742
00:54:16,323 --> 00:54:17,856
He's alive.

743
00:54:17,858 --> 00:54:19,525
What? How?

744
00:54:19,527 --> 00:54:21,692
He's alive! He must've
been on a different transport.

745
00:54:21,694 --> 00:54:23,162
We gotta go get him.

746
00:54:23,164 --> 00:54:24,329
<i>Your friend's
on that sky trash?</i>

747
00:54:24,331 --> 00:54:25,730
I guess he is.

748
00:54:25,732 --> 00:54:27,099
Might I introduce myself.

749
00:54:27,101 --> 00:54:31,602
I am C-3PO, human-cyborg
relations. And you are?

750
00:54:31,604 --> 00:54:32,770
Okay, that's gonna be
a problem.

751
00:54:32,772 --> 00:54:35,374
Hello.
I Babu Frik.

752
00:54:35,376 --> 00:54:36,844
Why, hello!

753
00:54:44,385 --> 00:54:46,985
Threepio, move your metal ass.
We're almost there.

754
00:54:46,987 --> 00:54:49,221
How dare you!
We've only just met.

755
00:54:49,223 --> 00:54:50,389
<i>Poe.</i>

756
00:54:50,391 --> 00:54:52,790
<i>Might get you
on a capital ship.</i>

757
00:54:52,792 --> 00:54:54,028
<i>Go help your friend.</i>

758
00:54:55,329 --> 00:54:56,929
Zorii, I don't think
I can take this.

759
00:54:56,931 --> 00:54:58,765
<i>I don't care
what you think.</i>

760
00:55:01,535 --> 00:55:03,634
We have to go. Now.

761
00:55:03,636 --> 00:55:05,804
- Come with us.
- <i>Poe.</i>

762
00:55:05,806 --> 00:55:06,905
Can I kiss you?

763
00:55:06,907 --> 00:55:08,209
<i>Go.</i>

764
00:55:13,746 --> 00:55:15,114
We've done nothing wrong!

765
00:55:15,116 --> 00:55:16,582
<i>No sudden moves.</i>

766
00:55:16,584 --> 00:55:18,219
<i>What is that? Stop moving.</i>

767
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,566
Medallion's good.

768
00:55:34,568 --> 00:55:36,535
Clear for entrance
into hangar 12.

769
00:55:36,537 --> 00:55:37,668
Hang on, Chewie.

770
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:39,171
We're coming.

771
00:55:39,173 --> 00:55:41,741
Whoever this Chewie
person is, this is madness!

772
00:55:51,751 --> 00:55:53,285
<i>Credentials and manifest.</i>

773
00:55:54,488 --> 00:55:56,090
<i>Close the blast doors.</i>

774
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,260
- You three, stay there.
- Happily.

775
00:56:01,262 --> 00:56:02,327
Which way?

776
00:56:02,329 --> 00:56:03,796
Uh, no idea. Follow me.

777
00:56:25,386 --> 00:56:26,885
<i>Drop your weapons.</i>

778
00:56:26,887 --> 00:56:29,888
It's okay that we're here.

779
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,223
<i>It's okay that you're here.</i>

780
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:32,658
<i>It's good.</i>

781
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,159
You're relieved
that we're here.

782
00:56:34,161 --> 00:56:35,360
<i>Thank goodness you're here.</i>

783
00:56:35,362 --> 00:56:36,461
<i>Welcome, guys.</i>

784
00:56:36,463 --> 00:56:37,829
Does she do that to us?

785
00:56:37,831 --> 00:56:39,833
We're looking for a prisoner
and his belongings.

786
00:56:41,602 --> 00:56:42,803
The cameras.

787
00:56:47,041 --> 00:56:48,775
They said
Chewie's this way.

788
00:56:58,986 --> 00:57:00,219
Rey, come on.

789
00:57:00,221 --> 00:57:02,389
The dagger is on this ship.
We need it.

790
00:57:03,357 --> 00:57:04,358
Why?

791
00:57:05,993 --> 00:57:07,993
A feeling. I'll meet you
back at the hangar.

792
00:57:07,995 --> 00:57:09,263
Rey, you can't just...

793
00:57:10,464 --> 00:57:11,465
Chewie.

794
00:57:17,238 --> 00:57:19,173
<i>Search the city again.</i>

795
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:23,609
<i>She's close.</i>

796
00:57:26,779 --> 00:57:28,413
Of course
we came for you, Chewie.

797
00:57:29,683 --> 00:57:31,285
Yeah, Rey's here.
She's gonna get the dagger.

798
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,757
Whose ship is this?

799
00:57:39,759 --> 00:57:42,060
The ship's this way.
Follow me.

800
00:57:42,062 --> 00:57:43,264
<i>Over here!</i>

801
00:57:44,698 --> 00:57:46,398
Wrong way!

802
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,402
There's not really
a right way, is there?

803
00:57:50,371 --> 00:57:51,771
<i>I found them.</i>

804
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,208
<i>Blast them!</i>

805
00:57:58,245 --> 00:57:59,511
<i>Over here!</i>

806
00:57:59,513 --> 00:58:00,514
<i>There they are.
Get them!</i>

807
00:58:16,397 --> 00:58:17,963
- We close?
- Straight ahead.

808
00:58:17,965 --> 00:58:19,166
<i>Blast them!</i>

809
00:58:21,502 --> 00:58:23,304
<i>Halt!</i>

810
00:58:25,906 --> 00:58:27,141
Poe!

811
00:58:30,511 --> 00:58:32,244
Are you okay?

812
00:58:32,246 --> 00:58:34,112
Nope.

813
00:58:34,114 --> 00:58:36,014
<i>You there, hands up!</i>

814
00:58:36,016 --> 00:58:37,916
<i>Drop your weapons now!</i>

815
00:58:37,918 --> 00:58:39,418
<i>Put your weapons down!</i>

816
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:41,086
<i>Drop them!</i>

817
00:58:41,088 --> 00:58:42,923
<i>Drop them now!</i>

818
00:58:44,525 --> 00:58:45,824
Hey, fellas.

819
00:58:45,826 --> 00:58:46,892
<i>Shut up, scum.</i>

820
00:59:27,735 --> 00:59:29,403
<i>No!</i>

821
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:31,737
<i>No!</i>

822
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:33,004
No.

823
00:59:33,006 --> 00:59:34,375
<i>Rey.</i>

824
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:38,276
<i>Wherever you are...</i>

825
00:59:38,278 --> 00:59:40,112
<i>you are hard to find.</i>

826
00:59:40,114 --> 00:59:41,949
You're hard to get rid of.

827
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:45,083
<i>I pushed you in the desert,</i>

828
00:59:45,085 --> 00:59:46,987
<i>because I needed to see it.</i>

829
00:59:47,888 --> 00:59:50,188
<i>I needed you to see it.</i>

830
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:52,859
<i>Who you are.</i>

831
00:59:52,861 --> 00:59:55,129
<i>I know
the rest of your story.</i>

832
00:59:57,231 --> 00:59:58,232
<i>Rey.</i>

833
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,033
You're lying.

834
01:00:02,035 --> 01:00:04,336
<i>I never lied to you.</i>

835
01:00:04,338 --> 01:00:05,939
<i>Your parents were no one.</i>

836
01:00:07,274 --> 01:00:08,675
<i>They chose to be.</i>

837
01:00:09,844 --> 01:00:11,042
<i>To keep you safe.</i>

838
01:00:11,044 --> 01:00:12,244
Don't!

839
01:00:12,246 --> 01:00:14,179
<i>You remember
more than you say.</i>

840
01:00:14,181 --> 01:00:15,614
<i>I've been in your head.</i>

841
01:00:15,616 --> 01:00:16,681
I don't want this!

842
01:00:16,683 --> 01:00:17,817
<i>Search your memories.</i>

843
01:00:17,819 --> 01:00:18,885
No!

844
01:00:22,824 --> 01:00:24,723
<i>Remember them.</i>

845
01:00:24,725 --> 01:00:26,126
<i>See them.</i>

846
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:31,331
My love.
Rey, be brave.

847
01:00:33,967 --> 01:00:35,369
You'll be safe here.

848
01:00:35,904 --> 01:00:37,337
I promise.

849
01:00:39,072 --> 01:00:40,439
Come back!

850
01:00:40,441 --> 01:00:41,442
No!

851
01:00:48,081 --> 01:00:50,449
<i>They sold you
to protect you.</i>

852
01:00:50,451 --> 01:00:51,416
Stop talking.

853
01:00:51,418 --> 01:00:53,718
<i>Rey, I know
what happened to them.</i>

854
01:01:02,396 --> 01:01:03,697
<i>Move it.</i>

855
01:01:05,232 --> 01:01:06,565
<i>Allegiant General,</i>

856
01:01:06,567 --> 01:01:07,867
<i>the scavenger is not
with them.</i>

857
01:01:07,869 --> 01:01:10,070
Take them away.
Terminate them.

858
01:01:15,509 --> 01:01:17,042
<i>Tell me where you are.</i>

859
01:01:17,044 --> 01:01:19,513
<i>You don't know
the whole story.</i>

860
01:01:23,016 --> 01:01:26,753
<i>It was Palpatine
who had your parents taken.</i>

861
01:01:27,956 --> 01:01:30,288
<i>He was looking for you.</i>

862
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:33,093
<i>But they wouldn't say
where you were.</i>

863
01:01:33,862 --> 01:01:35,596
<i>So he gave the order.</i>

864
01:01:40,067 --> 01:01:42,467
She isn't on Jakku.
She's gone.

865
01:01:42,469 --> 01:01:43,670
No!

866
01:01:45,038 --> 01:01:46,240
No!

867
01:01:56,016 --> 01:01:57,451
<i>So that's where you are.</i>

868
01:02:02,824 --> 01:02:05,624
<i>You know why the Emperor's
always wanted you dead.</i>

869
01:02:05,626 --> 01:02:07,192
No.

870
01:02:07,194 --> 01:02:08,629
<i>I'll come tell you.</i>

871
01:02:14,903 --> 01:02:17,704
<i>She was in my quarters.
Lock down the ship.</i>

872
01:02:21,708 --> 01:02:22,810
Actually...

873
01:02:24,177 --> 01:02:26,079
I'd like to do this myself.

874
01:02:30,284 --> 01:02:32,119
What were you gonna
tell Rey before?

875
01:02:32,954 --> 01:02:34,719
You still on that?

876
01:02:34,721 --> 01:02:36,087
Oh, I'm sorry,
is this a bad time?

877
01:02:37,224 --> 01:02:38,824
Yeah.
Sort of is a bad time, Poe.

878
01:02:38,826 --> 01:02:40,358
Well, 'cause later doesn't
really look like an option.

879
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,526
If you're gonna let
something off your chest,

880
01:02:41,528 --> 01:02:42,828
maybe now's not
the worst time to...

881
01:02:47,067 --> 01:02:48,500
I'm the spy.

882
01:02:48,502 --> 01:02:50,201
- What?
- You?

883
01:02:50,203 --> 01:02:51,703
We don't have much time.

884
01:02:51,705 --> 01:02:52,905
I knew it.

885
01:02:52,907 --> 01:02:54,406
No, you did not.

886
01:02:54,408 --> 01:02:55,407
<i>What's your operating number?</i>

887
01:02:57,077 --> 01:02:58,445
<i>That's not even a language.</i>

888
01:03:02,249 --> 01:03:04,783
Oh, dear!
My first laser battle.

889
01:03:04,785 --> 01:03:07,187
- Where are the others?
- They haven't come back.

890
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:14,593
Find them.

891
01:03:14,595 --> 01:03:16,196
- Go.
- Yes.

892
01:03:20,233 --> 01:03:22,334
Friends ahead.

893
01:03:22,336 --> 01:03:23,768
Oh, yes,
there they are!

894
01:03:23,770 --> 01:03:25,170
BB-8, come on!

895
01:03:25,172 --> 01:03:26,438
I'll shut down the
impeders. You've got seconds.

896
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,139
There she is.

897
01:03:28,141 --> 01:03:30,042
She's a survivor.

898
01:03:30,044 --> 01:03:31,343
Wait. Wait.

899
01:03:31,345 --> 01:03:33,311
- Blast me in the arm. Quick.
- What?

900
01:03:33,313 --> 01:03:34,514
Or they'll know.

901
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:38,483
No! Ahh!

902
01:03:38,485 --> 01:03:40,287
Why are you helping us?

903
01:03:41,154 --> 01:03:43,488
I don't care if you win.

904
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:46,193
I need Kylo Ren to lose.

905
01:04:11,451 --> 01:04:14,352
Why did the Emperor
come for me?

906
01:04:14,354 --> 01:04:16,891
Why did he want
to kill a child?

907
01:04:18,126 --> 01:04:19,557
Tell me.

908
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:21,795
<i>Because he saw
what you would become.</i>

909
01:04:22,864 --> 01:04:24,731
<i>You don't just have power.</i>

910
01:04:26,299 --> 01:04:28,400
<i>You have his power.</i>

911
01:04:28,402 --> 01:04:29,703
<i>You're his granddaughter.</i>

912
01:04:31,405 --> 01:04:34,708
<i>You are a Palpatine.</i>

913
01:04:42,449 --> 01:04:45,183
<i>My mother
was the daughter of Vader.</i>

914
01:04:45,185 --> 01:04:48,353
<i>Your father
was the son of the Emperor.</i>

915
01:04:48,355 --> 01:04:50,288
<i>What Palpatine
doesn't know</i>

916
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:52,892
<i>is we're a dyad
in the Force, Rey.</i>

917
01:04:52,894 --> 01:04:54,860
<i>Two that are one.</i>

918
01:05:02,402 --> 01:05:07,238
<i>We'll kill him together
and take the throne.</i>

919
01:05:15,850 --> 01:05:18,318
You know
what you need to do.

920
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,654
You know.

921
01:05:29,629 --> 01:05:31,030
I do.

922
01:05:38,371 --> 01:05:39,773
Hold her steady.

923
01:05:44,311 --> 01:05:45,512
Finn, move fast!

924
01:05:46,881 --> 01:05:48,346
Rey!

925
01:05:48,348 --> 01:05:50,381
Come on!

926
01:05:54,354 --> 01:05:55,687
Come on!
I got you!

927
01:06:03,797 --> 01:06:07,332
It was a coordinated
incursion, Allegiant General.

928
01:06:07,334 --> 01:06:08,733
They overpowered the guards

929
01:06:08,735 --> 01:06:10,470
and forced me
to take them to their ship.

930
01:06:10,972 --> 01:06:13,005
I see.

931
01:06:13,007 --> 01:06:14,372
Get me the Supreme Leader.

932
01:06:14,374 --> 01:06:15,542
Yes, sir.

933
01:06:19,579 --> 01:06:21,748
Tell him we found our spy.

934
01:06:24,618 --> 01:06:26,351
I don't know why
they're not following us,

935
01:06:26,353 --> 01:06:27,418
but I don't trust it.

936
01:06:28,688 --> 01:06:30,321
Landing gear's busted?
How busted?

937
01:06:32,059 --> 01:06:35,060
All that matters is the wayfinder.
Finding Exegol.

938
01:06:35,062 --> 01:06:36,730
That's what we're doing.

939
01:06:41,301 --> 01:06:43,436
He killed my mother.

940
01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:46,673
And my father.

941
01:06:48,708 --> 01:06:50,812
I'm going to find
Palpatine...

942
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:53,680
and destroy him.

943
01:06:55,315 --> 01:06:57,049
Rey...

944
01:06:57,051 --> 01:06:58,585
that doesn't sound
like you.

945
01:07:00,922 --> 01:07:02,554
Rey, I know you...

946
01:07:02,556 --> 01:07:04,558
People keep telling me
they know me.

947
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,829
I'm afraid no one does.

948
01:07:13,067 --> 01:07:17,635
<i>The Jedi
apprentice still lives.</i>

949
01:07:17,637 --> 01:07:21,639
<i>Perhaps you
have betrayed me.</i>

950
01:07:21,641 --> 01:07:25,811
<i>Do not make me
turn my fleet against you.</i>

951
01:07:25,813 --> 01:07:28,013
<i>I know where she's going.</i>

952
01:07:28,015 --> 01:07:29,347
<i>She'll never be a Jedi.</i>

953
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:31,016
<i>Make sure of it.</i>

954
01:07:31,018 --> 01:07:32,419
<i>Kill her.</i>

955
01:08:14,561 --> 01:08:16,262
What...
What is that?

956
01:08:16,264 --> 01:08:17,562
It's the Death Star.

957
01:08:17,564 --> 01:08:20,966
A bad place
from an old war.

958
01:08:20,968 --> 01:08:23,568
It's gonna take us years to
find what we're looking for.

959
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:25,670
Oh, dear.

960
01:08:25,672 --> 01:08:27,808
"Only this blade tells."

961
01:09:01,909 --> 01:09:04,442
The wayfinder's there.

962
01:09:04,444 --> 01:09:05,679
Heads up.

963
01:09:13,154 --> 01:09:14,552
Rough landing.

964
01:09:14,554 --> 01:09:16,756
- I've seen worse.
- I've seen better.

965
01:09:18,658 --> 01:09:20,192
Are you Resistance?

966
01:09:20,194 --> 01:09:21,860
That depends.

967
01:09:21,862 --> 01:09:24,196
We picked up a transmission
from someone named Babu Frik.

968
01:09:24,198 --> 01:09:27,800
Babu Frik? Oh,
he's one of my oldest friends.

969
01:09:27,802 --> 01:09:29,401
He said you'd come.

970
01:09:29,403 --> 01:09:31,205
He said
you were the last hope.

971
01:09:32,974 --> 01:09:34,639
We have to get to that wreck.

972
01:09:34,641 --> 01:09:36,442
There is something
inside there we need.

973
01:09:36,444 --> 01:09:37,910
I can take you there
by water.

974
01:09:37,912 --> 01:09:40,012
- Have you seen the water?
- Not now.

975
01:09:40,014 --> 01:09:41,579
Too dangerous.

976
01:09:41,581 --> 01:09:42,948
We can go
first light tomorrow.

977
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:45,219
We can't wait that long.
We don't have the time.

978
01:09:46,187 --> 01:09:47,953
Or the choice.

979
01:09:47,955 --> 01:09:49,754
Let's get that ship fixed.

980
01:09:49,756 --> 01:09:51,190
Do you have any spare parts?

981
01:09:51,192 --> 01:09:52,358
Some.

982
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:53,828
- I'm Jannah.
- I'm Poe.

983
01:10:03,703 --> 01:10:04,905
Hello.

984
01:10:07,174 --> 01:10:09,674
No, thank you. No, thank you.

985
01:10:09,676 --> 01:10:11,609
What a dreadful situation.

986
01:10:11,611 --> 01:10:14,079
Is every day like this
for you people?

987
01:10:14,081 --> 01:10:15,180
Madness.

988
01:10:15,182 --> 01:10:18,050
Did we ever find
his volume control?

989
01:10:18,052 --> 01:10:20,352
It's an O-6,
but should work.

990
01:10:20,354 --> 01:10:21,688
Thank you.

991
01:10:23,858 --> 01:10:25,357
This is a First Order part.

992
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:27,393
There's an old cruiser
on the west ridge.

993
01:10:27,395 --> 01:10:28,695
Stripped for parts.

994
01:10:29,696 --> 01:10:31,562
The one we were assigned to.

995
01:10:31,564 --> 01:10:33,664
The one we escaped in.

996
01:10:33,666 --> 01:10:37,136
Okay, wait.
You were First Order?

997
01:10:37,138 --> 01:10:38,172
Not by choice.

998
01:10:40,841 --> 01:10:43,710
We were conscripted
as kids. All of us.

999
01:10:44,577 --> 01:10:47,446
I was TZ-1719.
Stormtrooper.

1000
01:10:47,448 --> 01:10:48,849
FN-2187.

1001
01:10:49,917 --> 01:10:50,883
You?

1002
01:10:50,885 --> 01:10:52,351
I never knew
there were more.

1003
01:10:52,353 --> 01:10:55,720
Deserters? All of us here
were stormtroopers.

1004
01:10:55,722 --> 01:10:58,556
We mutinied at the battle
of Ansett Island.

1005
01:10:58,558 --> 01:11:00,691
They told us
to fire on civilians.

1006
01:11:00,693 --> 01:11:01,860
We wouldn't do it.

1007
01:11:01,862 --> 01:11:03,761
We laid our weapons down.

1008
01:11:03,763 --> 01:11:05,630
- All of you?
- The whole company.

1009
01:11:07,134 --> 01:11:10,335
I don't even know
how it happened.

1010
01:11:10,337 --> 01:11:13,205
It wasn't a decision, really,
it was like...

1011
01:11:13,207 --> 01:11:14,241
An instinct.

1012
01:11:15,309 --> 01:11:16,576
Feeling.

1013
01:11:17,211 --> 01:11:18,578
A feeling.

1014
01:11:19,547 --> 01:11:21,579
The Force.

1015
01:11:21,581 --> 01:11:23,217
The Force
brought me here.

1016
01:11:24,485 --> 01:11:28,120
It brought me to Rey.
And Poe.

1017
01:11:28,122 --> 01:11:30,623
You say that
like you're sure it's real.

1018
01:11:31,392 --> 01:11:33,325
It's real.

1019
01:11:33,327 --> 01:11:34,929
I wasn't sure then...

1020
01:11:36,831 --> 01:11:39,164
but I am now.

1021
01:11:39,166 --> 01:11:40,731
What is it, buddy?

1022
01:11:43,104 --> 01:11:44,939
What do you mean
you haven't seen her?

1023
01:12:00,254 --> 01:12:01,754
She took the skimmer?

1024
01:12:36,723 --> 01:12:37,956
What the hell
was she thinking?

1025
01:12:37,958 --> 01:12:39,992
Poe, we gotta go
after her.

1026
01:12:39,994 --> 01:12:41,293
We'll get
the <i>Falcon</i> fixed,

1027
01:12:41,295 --> 01:12:42,727
and get out there
as fast as we can.

1028
01:12:42,729 --> 01:12:44,296
No,
we're gonna lose her.

1029
01:12:44,298 --> 01:12:45,397
Look, she left us!
What do you wanna do? Swim?

1030
01:12:45,399 --> 01:12:46,565
She's not herself.

1031
01:12:46,567 --> 01:12:47,765
You have no idea
what she's fighting.

1032
01:12:47,767 --> 01:12:48,969
And you do?

1033
01:12:51,205 --> 01:12:53,305
Yeah, I do.

1034
01:12:53,307 --> 01:12:54,341
And so does Leia.

1035
01:12:55,476 --> 01:12:57,509
Well, I'm not Leia.

1036
01:12:57,511 --> 01:12:59,013
That's for damn sure.

1037
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:23,871
Finn.

1038
01:13:24,605 --> 01:13:26,006
There's another skimmer.

1039
01:16:15,976 --> 01:16:18,412
Don't be afraid
of who you are.

1040
01:16:52,513 --> 01:16:55,580
Look at yourself.

1041
01:16:55,582 --> 01:16:57,649
You wanted to prove to my
mother that you were a Jedi...

1042
01:16:57,651 --> 01:16:59,520
but you've proven
something else.

1043
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:05,058
You can't go back to her now.

1044
01:17:06,994 --> 01:17:08,295
Like I can't.

1045
01:17:10,531 --> 01:17:11,596
Give it to me.

1046
01:17:15,235 --> 01:17:18,205
The dark side
is in our nature.

1047
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:22,576
Surrender to it.

1048
01:17:23,544 --> 01:17:24,611
Give it...

1049
01:17:25,312 --> 01:17:26,846
to me.

1050
01:17:32,619 --> 01:17:36,323
The only way you're getting
to Exegol is with me.

1051
01:17:37,859 --> 01:17:39,224
No!

1052
01:18:12,192 --> 01:18:15,329
Leia knows
what must be done, Artoo.

1053
01:18:16,096 --> 01:18:18,330
To reach her son now...

1054
01:18:18,332 --> 01:18:22,035
will take all the strength
she has left.

1055
01:18:42,089 --> 01:18:43,490
Rey!

1056
01:18:45,659 --> 01:18:47,194
Rey!

1057
01:18:48,662 --> 01:18:50,063
No!

1058
01:19:22,897 --> 01:19:25,196
No, we can't follow them!

1059
01:19:25,198 --> 01:19:27,267
- I can't leave her!
- We can't!

1060
01:19:27,936 --> 01:19:29,403
Rey!

1061
01:21:07,267 --> 01:21:09,269
Ben.

1062
01:21:39,499 --> 01:21:40,500
Leia.

1063
01:22:58,545 --> 01:23:00,915
I did want
to take your hand.

1064
01:23:02,382 --> 01:23:03,985
Ben's hand.

1065
01:23:46,093 --> 01:23:49,462
Goodbye, dear princess.

1066
01:24:00,908 --> 01:24:03,175
Poe,
something's happened.

1067
01:24:03,177 --> 01:24:04,709
- Finn.
- This can't wait.

1068
01:24:04,711 --> 01:24:06,680
We've gotta see
the General.

1069
01:24:08,448 --> 01:24:09,649
She's gone.

1070
01:24:15,755 --> 01:24:17,056
Chewie...

1071
01:24:42,449 --> 01:24:43,885
Hey, kid.

1072
01:25:04,972 --> 01:25:06,205
I miss you, son.

1073
01:25:09,310 --> 01:25:10,575
Your son is dead.

1074
01:25:11,946 --> 01:25:13,014
No.

1075
01:25:17,985 --> 01:25:20,187
Kylo Ren is dead.

1076
01:25:22,422 --> 01:25:24,058
My son is alive.

1077
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:31,098
You're just a memory.

1078
01:25:32,565 --> 01:25:34,501
Your memory.

1079
01:25:38,471 --> 01:25:40,007
Come home.

1080
01:25:41,208 --> 01:25:42,742
It's too late.

1081
01:25:45,578 --> 01:25:47,014
She's gone.

1082
01:25:49,150 --> 01:25:51,917
Your mother's gone.

1083
01:25:51,919 --> 01:25:54,754
But what she stood for,
what she fought for...

1084
01:25:56,223 --> 01:25:57,724
that's not gone.

1085
01:26:04,265 --> 01:26:06,031
Ben.

1086
01:26:06,033 --> 01:26:07,732
I know
what I have to do...

1087
01:26:07,734 --> 01:26:09,736
but I don't know if I have
the strength to do it.

1088
01:26:20,081 --> 01:26:21,816
You do.

1089
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,128
Dad...

1090
01:26:39,599 --> 01:26:41,501
I know.

1091
01:27:02,056 --> 01:27:06,325
<i>The Princess of Alderaan
has disrupted my plan...</i>

1092
01:27:06,327 --> 01:27:10,728
<i>but her foolish act
will be in vain.</i>

1093
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:14,734
<i>Come to me on Exegol,
General Pryde.</i>

1094
01:27:16,937 --> 01:27:19,505
As I served you
in the old wars,

1095
01:27:19,507 --> 01:27:21,173
I serve you now.

1096
01:27:21,175 --> 01:27:25,610
<i>Send a ship
to a world they know.</i>

1097
01:27:25,612 --> 01:27:28,180
<i>Let it burn.</i>

1098
01:27:28,182 --> 01:27:30,782
<i>The Final Order begins.</i>

1099
01:27:30,784 --> 01:27:35,421
<i>She will come,
her friends will follow.</i>

1100
01:27:35,423 --> 01:27:36,857
Yes, my lord.

1101
01:27:47,001 --> 01:27:50,037
Levels
holding steady at 85%.

1102
01:27:51,272 --> 01:27:53,305
Captain.

1103
01:27:53,307 --> 01:27:55,775
- Kijimi is in range.
- Fire.

1104
01:28:14,962 --> 01:28:18,564
<i>Kijimi? How?</i>

1105
01:28:18,566 --> 01:28:21,033
A blast
from a Star Destroyer.

1106
01:28:21,936 --> 01:28:23,734
A ship from
the new Sith fleet.

1107
01:28:23,736 --> 01:28:25,304
Out of the Unknowns.

1108
01:28:25,306 --> 01:28:27,840
The Emperor sent a ship
from Exegol.

1109
01:28:27,842 --> 01:28:29,441
Does that mean every ship
in the fleet...

1110
01:28:29,443 --> 01:28:32,079
Has planet-killing weapons.
Of course they do.

1111
01:28:32,712 --> 01:28:34,446
All of them.

1112
01:28:34,448 --> 01:28:36,248
This is how he finishes it.

1113
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:37,682
Listen.

1114
01:28:37,684 --> 01:28:39,585
It's on every frequency.

1115
01:28:41,288 --> 01:28:43,522
"The Resistance is dead.

1116
01:28:43,524 --> 01:28:45,359
"The Sith flame will burn.

1117
01:28:46,393 --> 01:28:49,561
"All worlds,
surrender or die.

1118
01:28:49,563 --> 01:28:52,464
"The Final Order begins."

1119
01:28:52,466 --> 01:28:54,034
Leia made you acting general.

1120
01:28:55,369 --> 01:28:56,871
What now?

1121
01:29:05,379 --> 01:29:07,647
I gotta tell you,
I don't really know...

1122
01:29:08,516 --> 01:29:10,050
how to do this.

1123
01:29:11,519 --> 01:29:13,187
What you did...

1124
01:29:15,156 --> 01:29:16,756
I'm not ready.

1125
01:29:17,992 --> 01:29:19,692
Neither were we.

1126
01:29:22,930 --> 01:29:25,132
Luke, Han, Leia, me...

1127
01:29:25,866 --> 01:29:27,201
Who's ever ready?

1128
01:29:27,767 --> 01:29:29,069
How'd you do it?

1129
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:34,273
Defeat an empire
with almost nothing.

1130
01:29:34,275 --> 01:29:35,843
We had each other.

1131
01:29:36,844 --> 01:29:38,745
That's how we won.

1132
01:29:42,016 --> 01:29:43,882
Hey, don't touch that.
That's my friend's.

1133
01:29:43,884 --> 01:29:46,020
Sorry.
She is gone?

1134
01:29:46,786 --> 01:29:48,020
Yeah, she's gone.

1135
01:29:48,022 --> 01:29:49,290
I don't know where.

1136
01:29:50,357 --> 01:29:51,722
I miss her.

1137
01:29:51,724 --> 01:29:52,993
I miss her, too.

1138
01:29:55,795 --> 01:29:57,362
So, what's your name?

1139
01:29:57,364 --> 01:29:58,864
I gotta talk to you
about something.

1140
01:29:58,866 --> 01:30:00,032
I gotta talk to you
about something.

1141
01:30:00,034 --> 01:30:01,633
I can't do this alone.

1142
01:30:01,635 --> 01:30:03,135
I need you in command
with me.

1143
01:30:03,137 --> 01:30:05,170
This droid has...
Thank you. I appreciate that.

1144
01:30:05,172 --> 01:30:06,538
- General.
- General.

1145
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:08,507
This droid has a ton
of information about Exegol.

1146
01:30:08,509 --> 01:30:10,275
- Wait, what? Cone-face?
- I am D-O.

1147
01:30:10,277 --> 01:30:11,376
Sorry, D-O.

1148
01:30:11,378 --> 01:30:13,845
He was going to Exegol
with Ochi of Bestoon.

1149
01:30:13,847 --> 01:30:15,347
Why was Ochi going there?

1150
01:30:15,349 --> 01:30:16,682
To bring the little girl

1151
01:30:16,684 --> 01:30:19,284
he was supposed to take
from Jakku to the Emperor.

1152
01:30:19,286 --> 01:30:21,320
He wanted her alive.

1153
01:31:11,238 --> 01:31:14,975
A Jedi's weapon
deserves more respect.

1154
01:31:16,944 --> 01:31:19,378
Master Skywalker.

1155
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:22,180
What are you doing?

1156
01:31:22,182 --> 01:31:24,916
I saw myself
on the dark throne.

1157
01:31:24,918 --> 01:31:26,518
I won't let it happen.

1158
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:29,223
I'm never leaving this place.
I'm doing what you did.

1159
01:31:29,923 --> 01:31:31,892
I was wrong.

1160
01:31:32,993 --> 01:31:35,429
It was fear
that kept me here.

1161
01:31:36,930 --> 01:31:38,832
What are you most afraid of?

1162
01:31:43,337 --> 01:31:44,338
Myself.

1163
01:31:47,274 --> 01:31:49,276
Because you're a Palpatine.

1164
01:31:51,612 --> 01:31:53,380
Leia knew it, too.

1165
01:31:54,515 --> 01:31:55,983
She didn't tell me.

1166
01:32:03,157 --> 01:32:05,824
She still trained me.

1167
01:32:05,826 --> 01:32:08,694
Because she saw
your spirit.

1168
01:32:08,696 --> 01:32:10,331
Your heart.

1169
01:32:13,233 --> 01:32:14,268
Rey.

1170
01:32:15,402 --> 01:32:18,870
Some things are stronger
than blood.

1171
01:32:18,872 --> 01:32:22,507
Confronting fear
is the destiny of a Jedi.

1172
01:32:22,509 --> 01:32:24,209
Your destiny.

1173
01:32:24,211 --> 01:32:26,345
If you don't face
Palpatine...

1174
01:32:26,347 --> 01:32:28,582
it will mean the end
of the Jedi.

1175
01:32:30,017 --> 01:32:32,052
And the war will be lost.

1176
01:32:35,522 --> 01:32:38,492
There's something my sister
would want you to have.

1177
01:32:53,941 --> 01:32:55,542
Leia's saber.

1178
01:32:57,444 --> 01:32:59,880
It was the last night
of her training.

1179
01:33:16,964 --> 01:33:20,098
<i>Leia told me that she had
sensed the death of her son</i>

1180
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:23,769
<i>at the end of her Jedi path.</i>

1181
01:33:23,771 --> 01:33:27,773
<i>She surrendered her saber
to me and said that one day...</i>

1182
01:33:27,775 --> 01:33:29,941
it would be picked up
again...

1183
01:33:29,943 --> 01:33:33,046
by someone who would
finish her journey.

1184
01:33:34,915 --> 01:33:38,385
A thousand generations
live in you now.

1185
01:33:39,253 --> 01:33:42,354
But this is your fight.

1186
01:33:42,356 --> 01:33:45,259
You'll take both sabers
to Exegol.

1187
01:33:47,561 --> 01:33:48,960
I can't get there.

1188
01:33:48,962 --> 01:33:51,898
I don't have the wayfinder.
I destroyed Ren's ship.

1189
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:54,435
You have everything you need.

1190
01:34:04,578 --> 01:34:05,977
Two were made.

1191
01:35:02,336 --> 01:35:07,339
Oh, hello. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

1192
01:35:07,341 --> 01:35:09,708
And you are?

1193
01:35:09,710 --> 01:35:12,244
What?

1194
01:35:12,246 --> 01:35:14,446
Well, I am quite certain
I would remember

1195
01:35:14,448 --> 01:35:15,982
if I had a best friend.

1196
01:35:17,417 --> 01:35:19,284
You want to put what
in my head?

1197
01:35:19,286 --> 01:35:20,721
Under no circumstances...

1198
01:35:23,825 --> 01:35:26,826
Memory restoration complete.

1199
01:35:26,828 --> 01:35:28,493
Artoo, have you heard?

1200
01:35:28,495 --> 01:35:31,296
I am going with Mistress Rey
on her very first mission.

1201
01:35:32,599 --> 01:35:35,267
I already have?

1202
01:35:35,269 --> 01:35:37,471
Picking up a signal?
From whom?

1203
01:35:43,343 --> 01:35:45,878
All the information you need
for an airstrike on Exegol.

1204
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:47,145
Yeah, except
how to get there.

1205
01:35:47,147 --> 01:35:48,179
Are you seeing
these atmo readings?

1206
01:35:48,181 --> 01:35:49,247
It's a mess out there.

1207
01:35:49,249 --> 01:35:50,415
Magnetic crossfields.

1208
01:35:50,417 --> 01:35:52,150
Gravity wells,
solar winds.

1209
01:35:52,152 --> 01:35:53,385
How does a fleet
even take off from there?

1210
01:35:53,387 --> 01:35:54,586
Terribly sorry.

1211
01:35:54,588 --> 01:35:56,054
I'm afraid
Artoo's memory bank

1212
01:35:56,056 --> 01:35:58,590
must be crossed
with his logic receptors.

1213
01:35:58,592 --> 01:36:01,760
He says he is receiving
a transmission from

1214
01:36:01,762 --> 01:36:03,096
Master Luke.

1215
01:36:03,797 --> 01:36:05,399
That's an old craft ID.

1216
01:36:06,266 --> 01:36:08,233
That's Luke Skywalker's
X-wing.

1217
01:36:08,235 --> 01:36:10,335
It's transmitting
course marker signals

1218
01:36:10,337 --> 01:36:12,237
on its way
to the Unknown Regions.

1219
01:36:12,239 --> 01:36:13,572
It's Rey.

1220
01:36:18,111 --> 01:36:19,713
<i>She's going to Exegol.</i>

1221
01:36:24,351 --> 01:36:25,784
She's showing us.

1222
01:36:25,786 --> 01:36:27,654
She's showing us
how to get there.

1223
01:36:29,690 --> 01:36:31,857
Then we go together.

1224
01:36:37,164 --> 01:36:39,832
Come on, buddy,
we need you.

1225
01:36:39,834 --> 01:36:42,667
<i>As long as those
Star Destroyers are on Exegol</i>

1226
01:36:42,669 --> 01:36:43,768
we can hit them.

1227
01:36:43,770 --> 01:36:44,804
Hit them how?

1228
01:36:44,806 --> 01:36:46,137
They can't activate
their shields

1229
01:36:46,139 --> 01:36:47,539
until they leave atmosphere.

1230
01:36:47,541 --> 01:36:48,874
Which isn't easy on Exegol.

1231
01:36:48,876 --> 01:36:50,843
Ships that size
need help taking off.

1232
01:36:50,845 --> 01:36:52,677
Nav can't tell
which way's up out there.

1233
01:36:52,679 --> 01:36:54,212
So, how do the ships
take off?

1234
01:36:54,214 --> 01:36:56,015
They use a signal
from a navigation tower,

1235
01:36:56,017 --> 01:36:57,618
like this one.

1236
01:36:58,318 --> 01:36:59,551
Except they won't.

1237
01:36:59,553 --> 01:37:01,020
Air team's gonna
find the tower,

1238
01:37:01,022 --> 01:37:02,454
ground team's
gonna blast it.

1239
01:37:02,456 --> 01:37:04,222
- Ground team?
- I have an idea for that.

1240
01:37:04,224 --> 01:37:06,224
Once the tower's down,
the fleet will be stuck in atmo...

1241
01:37:06,226 --> 01:37:07,325
for just minutes,

1242
01:37:07,327 --> 01:37:09,160
with no shields,
and no way out.

1243
01:37:09,162 --> 01:37:10,395
We think hitting the cannons

1244
01:37:10,397 --> 01:37:12,364
might ignite
the main reactors.

1245
01:37:12,366 --> 01:37:13,866
That's our chance.

1246
01:37:13,868 --> 01:37:15,734
We need to pull
some Holdo maneuvers.

1247
01:37:15,736 --> 01:37:17,103
Do some real damage.

1248
01:37:17,105 --> 01:37:18,838
Come on.
That move is one in a million.

1249
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:20,238
Fighters and freighters
can take out their cannons

1250
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,373
if there are enough of us.

1251
01:37:21,375 --> 01:37:22,942
There aren't enough of us!

1252
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:25,343
He's right. We'd be
no more than bugs to them.

1253
01:37:25,345 --> 01:37:27,412
That's where Lando
and Chewie come in.

1254
01:37:27,414 --> 01:37:29,714
They'll take the <i>Falcon</i>
to the Core Systems.

1255
01:37:29,716 --> 01:37:32,183
Send out a call for help
for anybody listening.

1256
01:37:32,185 --> 01:37:33,518
We've got friends
out there.

1257
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:35,153
They'll come if they
know there's hope.

1258
01:37:36,790 --> 01:37:38,757
They will.

1259
01:37:38,759 --> 01:37:41,695
First Order wins by making
us think we're alone.

1260
01:37:42,329 --> 01:37:44,295
We're not alone.

1261
01:37:44,297 --> 01:37:46,868
Good people will fight
if we lead them.

1262
01:37:49,971 --> 01:37:52,404
<i>Leia never gave up.</i>

1263
01:37:52,406 --> 01:37:54,907
<i>And neither will we.</i>

1264
01:37:54,909 --> 01:37:57,310
<i>We're gonna show them
we're not afraid.</i>

1265
01:38:01,648 --> 01:38:04,315
<i>What our mothers
and fathers fought for...</i>

1266
01:38:04,317 --> 01:38:06,353
<i>we will not let die.</i>

1267
01:38:08,823 --> 01:38:09,957
<i>Not today.</i>

1268
01:38:11,324 --> 01:38:13,961
<i>Today, we make
our last stand.</i>

1269
01:38:14,761 --> 01:38:16,396
<i>For the galaxy.</i>

1270
01:38:18,231 --> 01:38:19,599
<i>For Leia.</i>

1271
01:38:22,302 --> 01:38:23,971
For everyone we've lost.

1272
01:38:25,205 --> 01:38:26,974
They've taken enough of us.

1273
01:38:27,909 --> 01:38:29,977
Now we take the war to them.

1274
01:38:56,603 --> 01:38:58,137
<i>She's on approach.</i>

1275
01:38:58,139 --> 01:39:00,973
<i>All ships rise
to deployment altitude.</i>

1276
01:39:40,915 --> 01:39:42,714
I know
it's a rough ride...

1277
01:39:42,716 --> 01:39:44,282
but stay locked
on Rey's course.

1278
01:39:50,958 --> 01:39:52,825
<i>Clear run frequency.</i>

1279
01:39:52,827 --> 01:39:55,194
<i>Captain, we have
Resistance craft incoming.</i>

1280
01:39:55,196 --> 01:39:56,361
Allegiant General...

1281
01:39:56,363 --> 01:39:57,731
<i>Use ion cannons!</i>

1282
01:40:03,137 --> 01:40:04,538
Look at that fleet.

1283
01:40:07,809 --> 01:40:08,810
Damn it!

1284
01:40:10,510 --> 01:40:11,846
Welcome to Exegol.

1285
01:40:15,348 --> 01:40:17,649
Watch your starboard, Wexley!

1286
01:40:17,651 --> 01:40:19,885
- Whoa!
- Get to their altitude.

1287
01:40:19,887 --> 01:40:21,989
They can't fire on us
without hitting each other.

1288
01:40:23,057 --> 01:40:24,489
Don't give up.

1289
01:40:24,491 --> 01:40:26,027
Help is coming.

1290
01:40:27,327 --> 01:40:28,526
There it is.

1291
01:40:28,528 --> 01:40:30,328
Poe, I see it.

1292
01:40:30,330 --> 01:40:31,631
I've got a visual
on the tower.

1293
01:41:20,513 --> 01:41:22,348
- Incoming TIEs!
- I see 'em!

1294
01:41:22,350 --> 01:41:23,550
I got you, Finn.

1295
01:41:27,787 --> 01:41:29,789
- You ready back there?
- Never been readier.

1296
01:41:32,126 --> 01:41:34,193
They're targeting
the navigation tower...

1297
01:41:34,195 --> 01:41:35,426
so the fleet can't deploy.

1298
01:41:35,428 --> 01:41:36,829
Then we won't use
that tower.

1299
01:41:36,831 --> 01:41:38,596
Switch over the source
of navigation signal

1300
01:41:38,598 --> 01:41:39,865
to this ship.

1301
01:41:39,867 --> 01:41:41,802
We'll guide
the fleet out ourselves.

1302
01:41:47,707 --> 01:41:50,009
The navigation tower
has been deactivated.

1303
01:41:50,011 --> 01:41:51,944
- What?
- Those ships need that signal.

1304
01:41:51,946 --> 01:41:53,611
It's gotta be coming
from somewhere.

1305
01:41:53,613 --> 01:41:55,381
<i>They figured out
what we're doing.</i>

1306
01:41:55,383 --> 01:41:57,349
<i>Call off the ground invasion.</i>

1307
01:41:57,351 --> 01:41:59,651
Wait.

1308
01:41:59,653 --> 01:42:01,987
The nav signal's coming
from that command ship.

1309
01:42:01,989 --> 01:42:03,621
That's our drop zone.

1310
01:42:03,623 --> 01:42:04,959
How do you know?

1311
01:42:05,893 --> 01:42:06,825
A feeling.

1312
01:42:06,827 --> 01:42:08,626
You wanna launch
a ground invasion

1313
01:42:08,628 --> 01:42:09,962
on a Star Destroyer?

1314
01:42:09,964 --> 01:42:11,462
I don't want to,
but we can't take out

1315
01:42:11,464 --> 01:42:12,664
that ship's nav system
from the air.

1316
01:42:12,666 --> 01:42:14,099
Give us cover.

1317
01:42:14,101 --> 01:42:15,500
We gotta keep that fleet
there till help arrives.

1318
01:42:15,502 --> 01:42:16,904
- We hope.
- We hope.

1319
01:42:18,172 --> 01:42:19,504
You heard the General.

1320
01:42:19,506 --> 01:42:22,109
All Wings,
cover that lander.

1321
01:42:26,780 --> 01:42:28,948
They've landed
a troop carrier.

1322
01:42:28,950 --> 01:42:30,983
- Jam the speeders.
- I can't, sir.

1323
01:42:30,985 --> 01:42:31,986
Why not?

1324
01:42:32,820 --> 01:42:34,155
They're not using speeders.

1325
01:42:39,961 --> 01:42:41,561
Not bad
for one lesson.

1326
01:42:42,396 --> 01:42:43,998
You had a good teacher!

1327
01:42:51,439 --> 01:42:52,639
Keep going!

1328
01:42:58,179 --> 01:42:59,677
You're doing great, buddy!

1329
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:01,481
The tower's up ahead.

1330
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:08,949
Long have I waited.

1331
01:44:18,826 --> 01:44:22,963
For my grandchild
to come home.

1332
01:44:25,232 --> 01:44:27,866
I never wanted you dead.

1333
01:44:27,868 --> 01:44:30,668
I wanted you here...

1334
01:44:30,670 --> 01:44:33,007
Empress Palpatine.

1335
01:44:35,443 --> 01:44:37,344
You will take the throne.

1336
01:44:40,014 --> 01:44:44,615
It is your birthright
to rule here.

1337
01:44:44,617 --> 01:44:48,387
It is in your blood.
Our blood.

1338
01:44:50,024 --> 01:44:52,925
I haven't come
to lead the Sith...

1339
01:44:52,927 --> 01:44:54,692
I have come
to end them.

1340
01:44:54,694 --> 01:44:56,761
As a Jedi?

1341
01:44:56,763 --> 01:44:59,398
- Yes.
- No.

1342
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:03,469
Your hatred, your anger.

1343
01:45:03,471 --> 01:45:05,940
You want to kill me.

1344
01:45:07,241 --> 01:45:09,243
That is what I want.

1345
01:45:10,643 --> 01:45:12,211
Kill me...

1346
01:45:12,213 --> 01:45:15,881
and my spirit
will pass into you.

1347
01:45:15,883 --> 01:45:19,717
As all the Sith
live in me...

1348
01:45:19,719 --> 01:45:22,687
you will be Empress...

1349
01:45:22,689 --> 01:45:24,925
we will be one.

1350
01:45:32,299 --> 01:45:34,366
Those thrusters are hot.
How are we doing?

1351
01:45:34,368 --> 01:45:36,935
We're gonna blow our way in,
and take out that nav tower.

1352
01:45:36,937 --> 01:45:38,470
All the hatches
are blast-proof!

1353
01:45:38,472 --> 01:45:39,905
All right, BB-8,
you're up!

1354
01:45:39,907 --> 01:45:41,342
I'll cover you.

1355
01:46:09,136 --> 01:46:11,270
This should do it.

1356
01:46:22,950 --> 01:46:24,385
There it goes.

1357
01:46:25,752 --> 01:46:27,186
Nice one, Finn.

1358
01:46:27,188 --> 01:46:29,388
Nav signal's down,
but not for long.

1359
01:46:29,390 --> 01:46:30,824
We're offline, sir.

1360
01:46:31,791 --> 01:46:33,358
Reset the navigation signal!

1361
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:34,395
Minutes away, sir.

1362
01:46:36,063 --> 01:46:38,230
- Finn, let's go!
- No, no, wait, listen.

1363
01:46:38,232 --> 01:46:39,531
The crown cannons
have stopped.

1364
01:46:39,533 --> 01:46:40,666
They're resetting
their systems.

1365
01:46:40,668 --> 01:46:43,370
- So?
- I gotta go do something.

1366
01:46:44,004 --> 01:46:45,772
I'm staying with you.

1367
01:46:47,774 --> 01:46:49,374
Still no <i>Falcon</i> or backup.

1368
01:46:50,678 --> 01:46:53,979
I don't know, Artoo.
Maybe nobody else is coming.

1369
01:46:53,981 --> 01:46:55,182
What do we do, General?

1370
01:46:56,217 --> 01:46:58,016
We gotta hit them ourselves.

1371
01:46:58,018 --> 01:46:59,151
What can we do
against these things?

1372
01:46:59,153 --> 01:47:01,121
<i>Just stay alive!</i>

1373
01:47:03,357 --> 01:47:05,725
The time has come!

1374
01:47:15,269 --> 01:47:19,004
With your hatred,
you will take my life.

1375
01:47:19,006 --> 01:47:21,108
And you will ascend.

1376
01:47:22,409 --> 01:47:26,013
All you want is for me
to hate, but I won't.

1377
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:28,148
Not even you.

1378
01:47:29,049 --> 01:47:32,353
Weak.
Like your parents.

1379
01:47:33,621 --> 01:47:35,356
My parents were strong.

1380
01:47:36,156 --> 01:47:38,357
They saved me from you.

1381
01:47:38,359 --> 01:47:42,961
Your Master, Luke Skywalker,
was saved by his father.

1382
01:47:42,963 --> 01:47:46,533
The only family
you have here...

1383
01:47:47,167 --> 01:47:48,402
is me.

1384
01:48:09,523 --> 01:48:12,924
They don't have long.

1385
01:48:12,926 --> 01:48:16,461
<i>No one is coming
to help them.</i>

1386
01:48:16,463 --> 01:48:20,434
<i>And you are the one
who led them here.</i>

1387
01:48:21,568 --> 01:48:25,237
<i>Strike me down.
Take the throne.</i>

1388
01:48:25,239 --> 01:48:27,606
<i>Reign over the new Empire...</i>

1389
01:48:27,608 --> 01:48:30,477
<i>and the fleet will be yours.</i>

1390
01:48:32,079 --> 01:48:36,150
<i>Only you have the power
to save them.</i>

1391
01:48:38,185 --> 01:48:42,956
<i>Refuse,
and your new family...</i>

1392
01:48:43,791 --> 01:48:45,826
dies.

1393
01:49:03,744 --> 01:49:05,379
Good.

1394
01:49:16,590 --> 01:49:18,058
Ow.

1395
01:49:20,961 --> 01:49:24,329
Finn, where are you?
The lander's leaving.

1396
01:49:24,331 --> 01:49:26,965
- <i>Finn!</i>
- Go without us.

1397
01:49:26,967 --> 01:49:28,902
We're taking
this entire ship down.

1398
01:49:30,571 --> 01:49:32,070
What? How?

1399
01:49:32,072 --> 01:49:33,540
<i>We're gonna hit
the command deck.</i>

1400
01:49:34,475 --> 01:49:37,244
Rose, please. Go.

1401
01:49:38,813 --> 01:49:40,912
- Rose!
- Rose!

1402
01:49:40,914 --> 01:49:42,549
I'll get the trigger!

1403
01:49:45,018 --> 01:49:47,586
The ritual begins.

1404
01:49:48,922 --> 01:49:51,156
She will strike me down...

1405
01:49:51,158 --> 01:49:54,626
and pledge herself
as a Sith.

1406
01:50:14,982 --> 01:50:17,482
<i>She will draw her weapon.</i>

1407
01:50:20,154 --> 01:50:22,687
She will come to me.

1408
01:50:36,103 --> 01:50:38,437
She will take her revenge.

1409
01:50:44,846 --> 01:50:47,779
And with a stroke
of her saber...

1410
01:50:47,781 --> 01:50:50,649
the Sith are reborn!

1411
01:50:51,820 --> 01:50:54,588
The Jedi are dead!

1412
01:51:15,877 --> 01:51:17,042
Do it!

1413
01:51:17,044 --> 01:51:19,413
Make the sacrifice!

1414
01:52:28,917 --> 01:52:32,751
Stand together,
die together.

1415
01:52:41,963 --> 01:52:45,098
The lifeforce of your bond...

1416
01:52:47,334 --> 01:52:50,970
a dyad in the Force.

1417
01:52:50,972 --> 01:52:54,274
A power like life itself.

1418
01:52:55,043 --> 01:52:58,777
Unseen for generations.

1419
01:52:58,779 --> 01:53:00,645
And now...

1420
01:53:00,647 --> 01:53:07,187
the power of two restores
the one, true Emperor.

1421
01:53:28,475 --> 01:53:29,741
<i>Snap,
they're on your tail.</i>

1422
01:53:29,743 --> 01:53:30,810
Yeah, I see 'em!

1423
01:53:30,812 --> 01:53:32,845
No, no, no, Snap, Snap!

1424
01:53:32,847 --> 01:53:34,348
No!

1425
01:53:36,583 --> 01:53:39,018
<i>Alpha Three is down.</i>

1426
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:41,553
<i>They're on my tail!
I can't get...</i>

1427
01:53:41,555 --> 01:53:43,357
<i>They're everywhere!</i>

1428
01:53:44,791 --> 01:53:46,660
<i>Delta leader's hit!</i>

1429
01:53:47,394 --> 01:53:48,793
<i>Losing altitude!</i>

1430
01:53:48,795 --> 01:53:50,595
<i>General,
what's our next move?</i>

1431
01:53:50,597 --> 01:53:52,797
<i>Poe, what now?</i>

1432
01:53:52,799 --> 01:53:54,201
My friends...

1433
01:53:56,603 --> 01:53:57,771
I'm sorry.

1434
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:00,641
I thought we had a shot.

1435
01:54:02,342 --> 01:54:05,310
But there's just
too many of them.

1436
01:54:05,312 --> 01:54:07,947
<i>But there are
more of us, Poe.</i>

1437
01:54:07,949 --> 01:54:09,783
<i>There are more of us.</i>

1438
01:54:20,828 --> 01:54:22,862
Look at this.

1439
01:54:22,864 --> 01:54:24,498
Look at this.

1440
01:54:33,206 --> 01:54:36,209
Lando, you did it.
You did it!

1441
01:54:38,378 --> 01:54:39,778
Hit those underbelly cannons.

1442
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:42,382
Every one we knock out
is a world saved.

1443
01:54:45,318 --> 01:54:46,687
Nice flying, Lando.

1444
01:54:56,864 --> 01:54:58,697
We have a ship down.
We lost a Destroyer.

1445
01:54:58,699 --> 01:55:00,298
Systems not responding.

1446
01:55:00,300 --> 01:55:01,433
Where did they get
all these fighter craft?

1447
01:55:01,435 --> 01:55:02,667
They have no navy.

1448
01:55:02,669 --> 01:55:05,706
It's not a navy, sir,
it's just people.

1449
01:55:16,516 --> 01:55:18,483
<i>So long, sky trash!</i>

1450
01:55:18,485 --> 01:55:19,751
Who's that flyer?

1451
01:55:19,753 --> 01:55:22,154
<i>Take a guess,
spice runner.</i>

1452
01:55:24,025 --> 01:55:26,894
Ha! Zorii! You made it!

1453
01:55:39,506 --> 01:55:42,942
Look what you have made.

1454
01:56:01,863 --> 01:56:05,131
As once I fell...

1455
01:56:05,133 --> 01:56:09,300
so falls
the last Skywalker.

1456
01:56:16,576 --> 01:56:20,212
Do not fear
that feeble attack...

1457
01:56:20,214 --> 01:56:22,514
my faithful.

1458
01:56:22,516 --> 01:56:26,486
Nothing will stop
the return of the Sith!

1459
01:56:38,199 --> 01:56:40,099
Artoo, my systems
are failing.

1460
01:56:41,169 --> 01:56:42,502
Does anyone copy?

1461
01:57:23,911 --> 01:57:25,579
Be with me.

1462
01:57:30,251 --> 01:57:32,053
Be with me.

1463
01:57:37,557 --> 01:57:39,559
Be with me.

1464
01:57:42,830 --> 01:57:46,098
<i>These are
your final steps, Rey.</i>

1465
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:48,968
<i>Rise and take them.</i>

1466
01:57:48,970 --> 01:57:50,936
- <i>Rey.</i>
- <i>Rey.</i>

1467
01:57:50,938 --> 01:57:52,338
<i>Rey.</i>

1468
01:57:52,340 --> 01:57:54,073
<i>Bring back
the balance, Rey, as I did.</i>

1469
01:57:54,075 --> 01:57:56,674
<i>In the night,
find the light, Rey.</i>

1470
01:57:56,676 --> 01:57:58,443
<i>You're not alone, Rey.</i>

1471
01:57:58,445 --> 01:58:00,445
<i>Alone never have you been.</i>

1472
01:58:00,447 --> 01:58:03,781
<i>Every Jedi
who ever lived lives in you.</i>

1473
01:58:03,783 --> 01:58:05,050
<i>The Force surrounds you, Rey.</i>

1474
01:58:05,052 --> 01:58:06,451
<i>Let it guide you.</i>

1475
01:58:06,453 --> 01:58:07,987
<i>As it guided us.</i>

1476
01:58:07,989 --> 01:58:09,687
<i>Feel the Force
flowing through you, Rey.</i>

1477
01:58:09,689 --> 01:58:11,056
<i>Let it lift you.</i>

1478
01:58:11,058 --> 01:58:12,790
<i>Rise, Rey.</i>

1479
01:58:12,792 --> 01:58:14,492
<i>We stand behind you, Rey.</i>

1480
01:58:14,494 --> 01:58:15,793
<i>Rey.</i>

1481
01:58:15,795 --> 01:58:17,863
<i>Rise in the Force.</i>

1482
01:58:17,865 --> 01:58:21,800
<i>In the heart of a Jedi
lies her strength.</i>

1483
01:58:21,802 --> 01:58:24,169
- <i>Rise.</i>
- <i>Rise.</i>

1484
01:58:24,171 --> 01:58:29,643
<i>Rey, the Force
will be with you, always.</i>

1485
01:58:47,828 --> 01:58:51,297
Let your death
be the final word...

1486
01:58:51,299 --> 01:58:54,135
in the story of rebellion.

1487
01:59:05,079 --> 01:59:07,379
I'm back on!
This is our last chance.

1488
01:59:07,381 --> 01:59:09,516
We gotta hit
those cannons now!

1489
01:59:13,720 --> 01:59:16,521
You are nothing!

1490
01:59:16,523 --> 01:59:20,861
A scavenger girl is no
match for the power in me.

1491
01:59:24,165 --> 01:59:27,866
I am all the Sith!

1492
01:59:30,537 --> 01:59:32,505
And I...

1493
01:59:37,644 --> 01:59:39,544
I'm all the Jedi.

1494
02:00:29,930 --> 02:00:31,731
Poe, the command ship!

1495
02:00:33,034 --> 02:00:34,766
<i>Their fleet is stuck here!</i>

1496
02:00:34,768 --> 02:00:36,137
They're toast!
Come on!

1497
02:00:39,940 --> 02:00:41,539
Finn, you seeing this?

1498
02:00:41,541 --> 02:00:43,208
Finn didn't board
the lander.

1499
02:00:43,210 --> 02:00:45,543
They're still
on that command ship?

1500
02:00:55,823 --> 02:00:58,857
I see them.
I'm going to get them.

1501
02:00:58,859 --> 02:01:00,426
General,
you won't make it.

1502
02:01:00,428 --> 02:01:01,793
Trust me, I'm fast!

1503
02:01:01,795 --> 02:01:03,831
<i>Not as fast
as this ship.</i>

1504
02:01:06,367 --> 02:01:08,869
Hold on, Chewie!

1505
02:01:18,379 --> 02:01:20,112
Finn!

1506
02:01:55,249 --> 02:01:57,351
No, Rey.

1507
02:04:20,394 --> 02:04:21,929
Ben.

1508
02:05:43,944 --> 02:05:45,546
<i>There, look!</i>

1509
02:05:46,280 --> 02:05:47,814
Red Five is in the air.

1510
02:05:47,816 --> 02:05:49,249
Rey's alive.

1511
02:05:50,884 --> 02:05:52,484
I see her.

1512
02:05:52,486 --> 02:05:55,287
<i>People are rising up
all over the galaxy.</i>

1513
02:05:55,289 --> 02:05:58,557
<i>Poe. We did it.</i>

1514
02:05:58,559 --> 02:05:59,593
We did it.

1515
02:06:56,116 --> 02:06:58,051
Happy.

1516
02:07:01,989 --> 02:07:03,290
Chewie!

1517
02:07:33,922 --> 02:07:35,086
Hi!

1518
02:07:35,088 --> 02:07:36,356
Good job!

1519
02:07:41,061 --> 02:07:42,429
Chewie.

1520
02:07:44,899 --> 02:07:47,000
This is for you.

1521
02:08:05,385 --> 02:08:07,087
Did you hear that?

1522
02:08:33,413 --> 02:08:35,313
Where are you from,
General?

1523
02:08:35,315 --> 02:08:37,351
The Gold system.

1524
02:08:41,923 --> 02:08:43,357
Well, what about you, kid?

1525
02:08:43,992 --> 02:08:45,624
Oh.

1526
02:08:45,626 --> 02:08:47,027
I don't know.

1527
02:08:48,997 --> 02:08:50,731
Well, let's find out.

1528
02:11:30,691 --> 02:11:33,326
There's been no one
for so long.

1529
02:11:34,028 --> 02:11:35,629
Who are you?

1530
02:11:37,131 --> 02:11:38,665
I'm Rey.

1531
02:11:39,834 --> 02:11:40,935
Rey who?

1532
02:12:05,792 --> 02:12:07,294
Rey Skywalker.

1533
02:12:25,014 --> 02:12:30,014
PRINCE ROGUE {PRAT3!K}

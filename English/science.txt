								 SURFACE TENSION


mathematically the surface tension is defined as stretching force per unit length on either side of imaginary line 

types of force: 1)cohesive 2)adhesive
cohesive force: the force of attraction ebtn the molecules of ame substance. example: force of attratin betn molecules of water
adhesive force: the force of attraction betn the molecules of two different substance is called adhesive force. example: the force of attraction betn the 
molecules of water and molecules of glass storing the water

interemolecular range: the maximum distance upto which one molecule can attract another molecule is known as molecular range. the moleculat range is 
abt 10^-9 m in solids and liquids

sphere of influence: a sphere drawn around the molecule as a center and with radius equal to the molecular range is called sphere of influence

surface film: the thinnest film of a liquid near its surface having thickness equal to the molecular range is called surface film
